# Atlas Exandria Catrographer's Guide
Atlas Exandria is an ambitious project to create a comprehensive, canon-consistent set of maps for the entire world of Exandria. While the current release only covers the continents of Tal'Dorei and Wildemount, the plan is to one day include maps of Issylra, Marquet, and the Shattered Teeth. Eventually, I hope to even include settlement maps and more. To help in the development of those future maps, I thought it wise to create this document to capture all of the settings and aesthetic choices used to create these maps.

All of the maps in the Atlas were created using the cartography application [Wonderdraft](https://wonderdraft.net). An amazing map-making tool, Wonderdraft has a large number of settings and design choices that can make maintaining consistency across multiple maps difficult. In addition to helping me create consistent maps, I wanted to help other recreate the look & feel of these maps so that they can make their own maps or conversions with the same look and feel. 

The maps in Atlas Exandria were created with [Wonderdraft](https://wonderdraft.net) 1.1.4.

## Appearance
While the land depicted in a map is the most important element of any map, the general look & feel of the map is the first thing viewers see and recognize. It sets the tone for the map and is nearly as important to the usability of the map as it's accuracy. This chapter documents the various settings used to create these maps.

### General Settings
The following settings are universal and used on all maps. They define the general look & feel of all maps and can be used to replicate this look & feel for your own maps.

|||

| **Textures**            | Worn / Worn   |
| **Coastal FX Distance** | ~ 33%  |
| **Landmass Outline**    | ~ 75%  |

### Color
For the Atlas Exandria maps, I opted to use a realistic, colorized look partly inspired by the old cloth maps of CRPGs from my youth. 

| Use      | Color   | Uses                         |
|:---------|:--------|:-----------------------------|
| Forest 1 | #5c6341 | Evergreen Forest             |
| Forest 2 | #636339 | Broadleaf & Jungle Forests   |
| Grass 1  | #9f9060 | Golden plains and grasslands |

| Grass 3  | #b3a873 | Plains, a little more arid   |
| Grass 4  | #ac9e6b | Another plains variant       |
| Swamp 1  | #9e915b | Marsh grasses, wetter plains |
| Swamp 2  | #878750 | Swamp grasses & wetlands     |
| Swamp 3  | #a2a255 | Really green wetlands        |
| Sand 1   | #dfdfa4 | Beaches, desert              |

##### Technique
When painting, use the grunge brush and lower the opacity, but keep the brush large. Multiple passes blend areas better than high opacity or a small brush. If you must decrease the brush size to fit into a smaller area, lower the opacity even more and make small light strokes.

##### Water's Edge
In addition to the standard coastline and freshwater edge colors in the universal settings, I also like to trace waterlines using different colors. A stretch of sandy beaches have a faint edge using the sand colors or rock for a rocky coast, while a river might have a faint dirt, mud, or sand edge. Again, the effect should be very subtle and just hint at the type of coastline. 

### Symbols
All of the symbols used in Atlas Exandria are stock, royalty-free symbols included in Wonderdraft. While there are a some great 3rd-party symbols available, I wanted these maps to be accesible to all Wonderdraft users and devoid of any potential licensing or copyright issues.

The symbols used in the maps are:
| Symbol Set    | Symbol           | Usage                      |Size |
|:--------------|:-----------------|:---------------------------|:---:|
| Custom Colors | Capital (Circle) | Capitals & Major Cities    |  30 |
| Custom Colors | City (Circle)    | Cities (2K to 10k)         |  30 |
| Custom Colors | Fortress         | Forts, Outposts, & Castles |  30 |
| Custom Colors | Town (Circle)    | Towns & Villages (< 2K)    |  30 |
| Custom Colors | City (Diamond)   | Ruins & Points of Interest |  30 |
| Trees         | Penciled Oaks    | Broadleaf Forests & Jungles|  30 |
| Trees         | Penciled Peins   | Evergreen Forests          |  30 |
| Mountains     | Penciled (Large) | Large Mountains            |  30 |
| Mountains     | Penciled (Small) | Small Mountains & Hills    |  30 |
{.gray}

***Note**: When working on the region maps, you may need to "unlock" the symbol sizes to scale the symbol to match. This setting is under preferences and advanced.*

#### Custom Colors Palette
The color palette for the Custom Colors symbols are:
- Color 1: #24140b
- Color 2: #9524221e
- Color 3: #4b463e

### Labels
The following are the starting points for all of the labels used on the continent maps. These colors and sizes are only a starting point. Labels are made bigger or smaller depending on the size and scale of the area to be labeled. I tend to stick to multiples of 8 (habit mostly) and rarely increase or decrease by more than 8-16 points. I also adjust colors slightly depending on the area surrounding the subject area. Typically to improve readability while maintaining the same look and feel.

*All labels use the **IM Fell English Italic** font.*

| Village            | #c8ffffff |   1   |   #c8000000 |  16 |
{.gray}

***Note:** Font sizes scale when creating detail maps based on the scale factor. Keep this in mind and adjust detail map fonts to match the new scale.*

#### Curvature
Curvature is an artistic choice and varies from one label to the next. It is useful for wrapping labels to natural contours and very few labels have no curvature. Do avoid excessive curvatures as it greatly reduces readability.

### Paths
Paths are used to denote the major roads and trails in the world. I use the path tool with the following settings for all roads: 
- Color: #b483756e
- Width: 2
- Type: 1
{.square}

#### Tracing
In addition to drawing roads using the above settings, I trace each road with the dirt color to help blend them into the countryside. The brush size is relatively small, a little wider than the path, and the opacity is set very low. The trace should be barely perceptible. I will make the trace a little darker for main roads and very light for trails and less-travelled paths. I also add a good deal of this trace around settlements, crossroads, and river crossings.

## Overlays
The use and style of overlays is a highly personal choice. The following settings are what I have used, but can just as easily be changed to suit your personal tastes. They are included for the purpose of replicating what I have done if you're creating your own versions or companion maps.

### Border
All of my maps use the **Double Line Transparent** border style with a **#080808** color and a size of **0.5**. 

This border works very well for digital maps, but you may have to make adjustments if you intend to have the map professionally printed. Different printers may have a "margin" or "bleed" area that could take anywhere from a 1/16 to an 1/8 of inch off the edge of the map. It is possible the map border will be too close to the edge and might look a little off. You'll want to talk to your printer and request a preview or recommendation from them prior to printing.

### Hex Overlay
A hex overlay is something people either love or hate. I myself am torn on them. I think they are ugly, but incredibly useful. I include a hex overlay on every map for the purpose of aiding in the rapid calculation of distances.

That being said, when I plan on getting professional prints, I will be turning off the hex overlay prior to submitting them. At the moment, I do not plan on releasing the maps without the grid, but ... I may change my mind.

#### Style
The grid overlay on all maps uses the **Pointed Hex** style on the **Below Symbols** layer with a line weight of **2** and a color of **#32080808**.

#### Hex Scale
The scale of the maps in this atlas are based on the official map of Tal'Dorei from the 1.1 release of the Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting Guide by Adam Law. The continent of Tal'Dorei in the Atlas is a 1:1 representation of that map and all other continents and regions are positioned and scaled to that reference map.

The numbers are approximate distances for the various dimensions of a hexagon. The actual numbers are in parenthesis, but I recommend rounding for your own sanity.

- **F2F**: The distance across the hexagon from one face to the opposite face.
- **V2V**: The distance across the hexagon, diagonally from one vertex to vertex.
- **V2C**: The distance from a vertex to the center of the hexagon. Also the length of a single face.
{.square}

| Type     | Zoom | Size   | F2F | V2V         | V2C       | Area            |
|:---------|:----:|:------:|:---:|:-----------:|:---------:|:---------------:|
| World    | 1x   |**130** | 120 | 140 (138.6) | 70 (69.3) | 12,000 (12,471) |
| Continent| 1.5x | **98** |  60 |  70 (69.3)  | 35 (34.6) |  3,000  (3,118) |
| Region   | 6x   |**196** |  30 |  35 (34.6)  | 17 (17.3) |    780  (779.4) |  
{.gray}

***Note:** The scale of the Wildemount map in the Explorer's Guide to Wildemount is different than the scale of the Tal'Dorei map used in this atlas. I started working on my maps years before the EGtW map came out and I'm sticking with the original map from the Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting Guide as my reference. The differences are minor and should not affect gameplay in any way.*

### Title Blocks
The title blocks for all maps use the **IM Fell English Italic** font with a base color of **#282828** and a highlight color of **#732828**. The boxes use a background color of **#919191** and the style **Double Line Opaque**.

#### Text
Text in the title blocks are just labels and they will always appear above the title block. I recommend creating your text first and then sizing your title block to it. You will most likely have to reposition the block and text a couple of times to get everything where you want it.

The font sizes for the different elements in my title blocks are:
| Map    | Use | Size     |
|:-------|:------------------------------------------------|:---:|
| World  | Primary Title (Exandria)                        | 181 |
| World  | Secondary Title (Sovereign Uriel Tal'Dorei III) | 45  |
| World  | Tertiary Title (Council of Tal'Dorei)           | 34  |
| World  | General Text                                    | 22  |
| Region | Primary Title                                   | 96  |
{.gray}

#### Highlighting
Wonderdraft does not support different font colors or sizes in the same label. In order to create the initial capital highlight you must put a label over a label. You simply create the word you want in the base color and then create another label in the highlight color. You then need to position the new label over the base label. It takes some work, but it is not difficult. You cannot control the layer the label is on, but Wonderdraft simple puts new labels over old labels. Simply create your highlights last.
