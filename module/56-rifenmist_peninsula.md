### Beynsfal Plateau
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Rifenmist^ ^Peninsula^](rifenmist-peninsula) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Hill^ ^&^ ^Coastal^

The Beynsfal Plateau is an arid, rocky high plain located at the extreme southern tip of the [Rifenmist Peninsula](rifenmist-peninsula). A cruel and unforgiving landscape, it is littered with basalt, raw iron and not much else. It is a stark contrast to the rich and verdant [Rifenmist Jungle](rifenmist-jungle) to the north. 

The Beynsfal Plateau is a dangerous and inhospitable wasteland. The harsh climate is unforgiving for the unprepared and many dangerous beasts and monstrosities stalk the rocky flats looking for an easy meal. While travelers must be wary of these natural predators, the real threat comes from the [hobgoblins](hobgoblins) of the [Iron Authority](iron-authority).

The combined might of the city-states of [Rybad-Kol](rybad-kol), [Hdar-Fye](hdar-fye), [Ezordam-Haar](ezordam-haar), [Ortem-Vellak](ortem-vellak) and [Tz'Arrm](tzarrm) dominate the plateau and subjugate all in their path. Trespassers are lucky if death finds them quickly, lest they find themsleves toiling in the forges and foundries that power the [Iron Authority's](iron-authority) thirst for war.

### Mornset Countryside
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Rifenmist^ ^Peninsula^](rifenmist-peninsula) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Grassland^

The Mornset Countryside is a wide open plain that stretches for hundreds of miles from the [Ozmit](ozmit-sea) shore of western [Tal'Dorei](taldorei) to the towering [Stormpoint Mountains](stormpoint-mountains). The openness of the plain stands in stark contrast to the closeness of the temperate [Verdant Expanse](verdant-expanse) to the north and the tropical [Rifenmist Jungle](rifenmist-jungle) to the south.

A number of small settlements dot the countryside, but the city of [Port U'daa](port-udaa) and the village of [Byroden](byroden) are the largest.

> For some reason, [Port U'daa](port-udaa) is not marked on any of the current maps of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei). The city was nearly destroyed by [Thordak](thordak), but still stands on the western edge of the Mornset. Likewise, numerous hamlets and homesteads sprinkle the plains.

### Orroyen River
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Verdant^ ^Expanse^](verdant-expanse) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Jungle^

The Orroyen River is long river that winds through the eastern [Rifenmist Jungle](rifenmist-jungle) in southeastern [Tal'Dorei](taldorei). The river begins on the eastern slope of the [Stormpoint Mountains](stormpoint-mountains) and twists and turns for a little over 500 miles through the jungle to the [Lucidian Ocean](lucidian-ocean). 

There are no permanent settlements in the Orroyen River basin, but it is home to many nomadic [Tabaxi](tabaxi) tribes and the semi-nomadic [Orroyen Tribe](orroyen-tribe).

*^Canon^ ^Consistency:^ **^Medium^**

> While unmarked on most modern maps of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei), the river is widely known by this name to the indigenous people of the eastern [Rifenmist](rifenmist-jungle). If another, official, name is discovered, I will update the Encyclopedia accordingly.

### Rifenmist Jungle
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Rifenmist^ ^Peninsula^](rifenmist-peninsula) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Jungle^

The Rifenmist Jungle is a massive rainforest that dominates the aptly named [Rifenmist Peninsula](rifenmist-peninsula) in southern [Tal'Dorei](taldorei). Larger than the [Verdant Expanse](verdant-expanse) and [Parchwood Timberland](parchwood-timberland) combined, the Rifenmist is [Tal'Dorei's](taldorei) largest forest at well over 100,000 square miles of wild, untamed wilderness.

The Rifenmist is divided in two by the [Stormpoint Mountains](stormpoint-mountains) with the western side being the larger of the two. Two large river basins dominate their respective halves with the [Rifenmist River](rifenmist-river) in the west and the [Orroyen River](orroyen-river) in the east.

While there are no permanent settlements in the jungle, the Rifenmist is home to numerous tribes of various races. The largest and most well-known being the [wood elves](elves) of the [Orroyen](orroyen-tribe). Also native to the jungle are most of [Exandria's](exandria) [tabaxi](tabaxi) clans.

> The names of the rivers are not documented on any current maps of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei), but having traveled the jungle myself and speaking with the locals, I have named them based on their input. If an official name exists elsewhere, I will update the Encyclopedia accordingly.

### Rifenmist River
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Rifenmist^ ^Peninsula^](rifenmist-peninsula) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Jungle^

The Rifenmist River basin is the central artery that brings life to the western [Rifenmist Jungle](rifenmist-jungle). The main, or upper, branch of the Rifenmist River begins high on the western slope of the [Stormpoint Mountains](stormpoint-mountains) in the central [Rifenmist Peninsula](rifenmist-peninsula). From there, it carves it's way westward through the jungle, gaining water from countless smaller tributaries along the way. 

The largest of the Rifenmist's tributaries is the one most commonly referred to as the lower branch. The branch's source lies near the [hobgoblin](hobgoblins) city of [Ezordam-Haar](ezordam-haar) and heads northward into the heart of the jungle. The Rifenmist expands greatly at the confluence of the two branches and pushes westward for another hundred miles to the [Ozmit Sea](ozmit-sea).

### Stormpoint Mountains
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Rifenmist^ ^Peninsula^](rifenmist-peninsula) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Mountain^

While technically part of the same mountain range as the [Stormcrest Mountains](stormcrest=mountains), the Stormpoints shoot southward from the western [Stormcrests](stormcrest-mountains), along the eastern edge of the [Verdant Expanse](verdant-expanse) and [Mornset Countryside](mornset-countryside). It continues further south into the [Rifenmist Peninsula](rifenmist-peninsula) and splits the [Rifenmist Jungle](rifenmist-jungle) in two.

While the [Stormcrests](stormcrest-mountains) are mostly bald and rocky, the Stormpoints are lush and green at the base of the mountain range and encased in perpetual fog at the peaks. The forests of the [Verdant Expanse](verdant-expanse), [Rifenmist Jungle](rifenmist-jungle), and [Dreamseep Marshlands](dreamseep-marshlands) grow up and over all but the tallest of the range's peaks.

Rumored to be the home of [Raishan the Diseased Deceiver](raishan-the-diseased-deceiver), treasure hunters are scouring the mountains looking for her lost hoard.
