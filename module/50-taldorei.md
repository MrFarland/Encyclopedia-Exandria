# Tal'Dorei
The continent of Tal'Dorei is located in the heart of [Exandria](exandria), nestled between the continents of [Issylra](Issylra) to the west and [Wildemount](wildemount) to the east. While not as large as [Issylra](Issylra) or as populous as [Wildemount](wildemount), [Tal'Dorei](taldorei) is growing quickly.  The slowest to recover following the Calamity, Tal'Dorei has made up for lost time and is growing in population, wealth and power.

##### Regions
The continent of Tal'Dorei is divided into the following eight regions:
- [Alabaster Sierras](alabaster-sierras)
- [Bladeshimmer Shoreline](bladeshimmer-shoreline)
- [Cliffkeep Mountains](cliffkeep-mountains)
- [Dividing Plains](dividing-plains)
- [Lucidian Coast](lucidian-coast)
- [Rifenmist Peninsula](rifenmist-peninsula)
- [Stormcrest Mountains](stormcrest-mountains)

## Alabaster Sierras
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei)

^Area:^ **^63,911^ ^sq^ ^mi^** ^-^ ^Population:^ **^5,288^**

Located in the northeast corner of the continent, the Alabaster Sierras are named for the chalk-white mountains that run the length of the Alabaster Peninsula. While named for the Alabaster Sierra range, it is the massive [Parchwood Timberland](parchwood-timberland) that truly dominates the region.

The region is bordered by the [Dividing Plains](dividing-plains) and [Lucidian Coast](lucidian-coast) to the south and by water to the east, north, and west. The Alabaster and [Dawnmist Bay](dawnmist-bay)s frame the peninsula and the [Shearing Channel](shearing-channel) separates the region from the continent of [Wildemount](wildemount) to the east.

##### Climate
The region has a **humid continental climate (Dfb)** with long, cold winters with plenty of snowfall. Summers are warm, but short with a fair amount of rain.

### Alabaster Bay
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Alabaster^ ^Sierras^](alabaster-sierras)
![Alabaster Bay](assets/img/geography-alabaster_bay.jpg)

^Type:^ **^Underwater^** ^-^ ^Danger:^ **^Normal^** ^-^ ^Terrain:^ **^Normal^**

The [Alabaster Bay](alabaster-bay) is a large bay located on the east side of the [Alabaster Peninsula](alabaster-sierras) and west of the [Shearing Channel](shearing-channel). While not as rough as the open waters of the [Frigid Depths](frigid-depths), the [Alabaster Bay](alabaster-bay) offers little protection from the brutal storms that plague, [Exandria's](exandria) northern ocean.

##### Dangers
[Killer whales](/monster/killer-whale) and [sea lions](/monster/sea-lion) hunt seals along the western shore and [harpies](/monster/harpy) and [wyverns](/monster/wyvern) attack ships that get too close to the [Alabaster Sierras](alabaster-sierra-range).

##### Environment
During the winter months, **Extreme Cold** and **Frigid Water** can prove fatal for the unprepared.

##### Foraging
^Food:^ **^Abundant^** ^-^ ^Water:^ **^Rare^**

Fish and crabs are plentiful and with the proper tools easy to catch. Fresh water is scarce.

##### Travel

Travel is usually uneventful, but winter storms, heavy fog, and the occassional iceberg blow in from the [Frigid Depths](frigid-depths).

### Alabaster Sierra Range

[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Alabaster^ ^Sierras^](alabaster-sierras)
![Alabaster Sierras](assets/img/geography-alabaster_sierras.jpg)

^Type:^ **^Mountain^** ^-^ ^Danger:^ **^High^** ^-^ ^Terrain:^ **^Difficult^**

Named for their chalk-white color, the Alabaster Sierra range stretches three hundred miles along the western shore of the [Alabaster Bay](alabaster-bay) and hook around the northern tip to form the towering cliffs of the [Salted Bluffs](salted-bluffs). 

##### Dangers
[Giants](/monster/stone-giant), [goblins](/monster/goblin), [kobolds](/monster/kobold), and [orcs](/monster/orc) give the people of [Whitestone](whitestone) a wide berth, but do not tolerate trespassers.

[Harpies](/monster/harpy) and [wyverns](/monster/wyvern) nest in the mountain peaks and travelers must keep an eye on the skies at all times.

##### Environment
During the winter months, **Extreme Cold**, **Frigid Water** and blinding snowstorms are a common occurence as are rock slides and avalanches.

##### Foraging
^Food:^ **^Limited^** ^-^ ^Water:^ **^Abundant^**

Food becomes harder to find the higher one gets, but cold, clear streams can be found throughout the mountains.

##### Travel
The Sierras are difficult to traverse and travelers are advised to bring climbing gear and an experienced guide.

### Alabaster Trail
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Alabaster^ ^Sierras^](alabaster-sierras)
![Alabaster Trail](assets/img/geography-alabaster_trail.jpg)

^Type:^ **^Forest^** ^-^ ^Danger:^ **^High^** ^-^ ^Terrain:^ **^Normal^**

The [Alabaster Trail](alabaster-trail) is a small road that connects the city of [Whitestone](whitestone) at the northern tip of the [Alabaster Peninsula](alabaster-sierras) to the rest of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei). It winds southward for a little more than 360 miles through the [Parchwood Timberland](parchwood-timberland) to the town of [Turst Fields](turst-fields) in the eastern [Dividing Plains](dividing-plains).

##### Dangers
[Bandits](/monster/bandit) and the more aggressive [orc](/monster/orc) and [gnoll](/monster/gnoll) tribes in the area are a constant threat on the southern end of the road, but even they avoid the stretch through [Parchwood](parchwood-timberland).

##### Environment
While the [forest](parchwood-timberland) provides some shelter from the elements, **extreme cold** and **heavy snow** are common in winter.

##### Foraging
^Food:^ **^Abundant^** ^-^ ^Water:^ **^Limited^**

For much of it's length, edible plants, berries, and game can be found without a lot of effort. Fresh water is more scarce, with most streams near the road slow-moving and murky.

##### Travel
Travel on the [Alabaster Trail](alabaster-trail) is very dangerous and travelers are encouraged to travel in caravans and never at night.

### Dawnmist Bay
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Alabaster^ ^Sierras^](alabaster-sierras)
![Dawnmist Bay](assets/img/geography-dawnmist_bay.jpg)

^Type:^ **^Underwater^** ^-^ ^Danger:^ **^Normal^** ^-^ ^Terrain:^ **^Normal^**

Located on the western side of the [Alabaster Peninsula](alabaster-sierras), the [Dawnmist Bay](dawnmist-bay) is a large, sheltered bay that drives deep into the continent of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei) . While technically an extension of the [Frigid Depths](frigid-depths), the bay is warmer and calmer than the [Alabaster Bay](alabaster-bay) on the other side of the peninsula. 

##### Dangers
A breeding ground for whales from the [Frigid Depths](frigid-depths), the bay is also home to a [sea monster](/monster/plesiosaurus) nicknamed "Misty".

##### Environment
The bay is named for the thick fog that often creeps in from the [Cliffkeeps](cliffkeep-mountain-range) to the west, **heavily obscuring** the bay.

##### Foraging
^Food:^ **^Abundant^** ^-^ ^Water:^ **^Rare^**

The bay is home to a variety of fish and catching them is not difficult for anyone with the proper tools.

##### Travel
While the bay is often calm, the fog makes navigating difficult by hiding dangerous shoals and islands.

### Parchwood Bay
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Alabaster^ ^Sierras^](alabaster-sierras)
![Parchwood Bay](assets/img/geography-parchwood_bay.jpg)

^Type:^ **^Underwater^** ^-^ ^Danger:^ **^High^** ^-^ ^Terrain:^ **^Difficult^**

The [Parchwood Bay](parchwood-bay) is an island-choked bay on the west side of the [Shearing Channel](shearing-channel) that separates [Tal'Dorei](tal'dorei) and [Wildemount](wildemount). While the bay seems like a great place to ride out a storm, the bay is a maze of heavily [forested](parchwood-timberland) islands and shoals that make navigating difficult. 

##### Dangers
The [Parchwood Bay](parchwood-bay) is crawling with terrible creatures of the deep. Sailors have reported coming across [hags](/monster/sea-hag), [giant crabs](/monster/giant-crabs), ghost ships, and even a [kraken](/monster/kraken).

##### Environment
While the bay provides some shelter from the storms that plague the [Shearing Channel](shearing-channel), they rocky islands and shoals leave little room to manuever in a bad storm.

##### Foraging
^Food:^ **^Abundant^** ^-^ ^Water:^ **^Limited^**

The bay is home to a vibrant marine ecosystem and many islands are rich with edible plants and wild game. Some of the larger islands have a source of fresh water.

##### Travel
Navigating the bay is difficult. The tall, forested islands, rocky shoals, and perpetually overcast weather make it hard to find the way out, once the [channel](shearing-channel) has been lost.

### Parchwood Timberland
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Alabaster^ ^Sierras^](alabaster-sierras)
![Parchwood Timberland](assets/img/geography-parchwood_timberland.jpg)

^Type:^ **^Forest^** ^-^ ^Danger:^ **^Very^ ^High^** ^-^ ^Terrain:^ **^Difficult^**

The [Parchwood Timberland](parchwood-timberland) is a massive evergreen forest that dominates the entire northeastern corner of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei). The forest is an unholy combination of towering trees and a thick, almost impenetrable underbrush. 

##### Dangers
While the forest is home to countless woodland beasts, the Parchwood is best known for the dire beasts, undead, corrupted plants, and lycanthropes that dwell within.

##### Environment
Winters are hard in the [Parchwood Timberland](parchwood-timberland). **Extreme cold** and **heavy snow** are common in the winter months and well into spring.

##### Foraging
^Food:^ **^Abundant^** ^-^ ^Water:^ **^Abundant^**

Edible plants, wild game, and fresh water are readily available in the Parchwood, but so are poisonous plants, dangerous beasts, and contaminated water.

##### Travel
Travelers are warned to stick to the [Alabaster Trail](alabaster-trail) on their way to and from the city of [Whitestone](whitestone) and to never stray from the trail. Those that do are rarely seen again.

### Salted Bluffs
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Alabaster^ ^Sierras^](alabaster-sierras)
![Salted Bluffs](assets/img/geography-salted_bluffs.jpg)

^Type:^ **^Forest^** ^-^ ^Danger:^ **^Very^ ^High^** ^-^ ^Terrain:^ **^Difficult^**

The [Salted Bluffs](salted-bluffs) are white cliffs that wrap around the north end of the [Alabaster Peninsula](alabaster-peninsula). The Bluffs stretch from the [Alabaster Bay](alabaster-bay) in the east to the [Dawnmist](dawnmist-bay) in the west, the [Salted Bluffs](salted-bluffs) are a network of towering spires, hidden coves, and caves.

##### Dangers
The greatest danger in the [Salted Bluffs](salted-bluffs) come not from the water, but the sky. [Harpies](/monster/harpy), [wyverns](/monster/wyvern), and [griffons](/monster/griffon) all nest in the towering spires swoop down on unsuspecting prey.

##### Environment
The [Salted Bluffs](salted-bluffs) are blasted by surging tides and **strong winds** year-round and **extreme cold** and **frigid water** during the long, cold winters.

##### Foraging
^Food:^ **^Limited^** ^-^ ^Water:^ **^Rare^**

Food and water are hard to come by in the [Salted Bluffs](salted-bluffs). There are few edible plants in the area and harvesting fish is difficult in the powerful tide.

##### Travel
Travel of any kind is difficult near the [Salted Bluffs](salted-bluffs). The rough tide, uneven ground, and strong winds make it difficult to navigate the area by boat, foot, or in the air.

### Shearing Channel
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Alabaster^ ^Sierras^](alabaster-sierras)
![Shearing Channel](assets/img/geography-shearing_channel.jpg)

^Type:^ **^Forest^** ^-^ ^Danger:^ **^Very^ ^High^** ^-^ ^Terrain:^ **^Difficult^**

The [Shearing Channel](shearing-channel) is a narrow channel that seperates the continents of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei) and [Wildemount](wildemount). The channel is less than 60 miles wide at it's narrowest point and roughly 300 miles from the temperate [Lucidian Ocean](lucidian-ocean) to the icy [Frigid Depths](frigid-depths).


##### Dangers
While the Channel itself is dangerous enough on its own, sailors are always on the lookout for the many sea monsters they hear tales of in [Port Damali](port-damali) and [Stilben](stilben).

##### Environment
Powerful storms, surging tides, and strong winds are the greatest danger to any vessel attempting the narrow passage between [Tal'Dorei](taldorei) and [Wildemount](wildemount).

##### Foraging
^Food:^ **^Abundant^** ^-^ ^Water:^ **^Rare^**

While there are plenty of fish in the sea, catching them in the tumultuous waters of the [Shearing Channel](shearing-channel) requires some skill.

##### Travel
While the traversing the channel should take no more than three days, ships can spend a week fighting violent storms and shifting currents before emerging on the other side.

### Upper Mooren River Run
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Alabaster^ ^Sierras^](alabaster-sierras)
![Upper Mooren River Run](assets/img/geography-upper_mooren_river_run.jpg)

^Type:^ **^Forest^** ^-^ ^Danger:^ **^Very^ ^High^** ^-^ ^Terrain:^ **^Difficult^**

The [Upper Mooren River Run](upper-mooren-river-run) is a long, fast-moving river that stretches over 600 miles from the northern tip of the [Alabaster Peninsula](alabaster-sierras) to the city of [Drynna](drynna) on the west bank of [Mooren Lake](mooren-lake). 

##### Dangers
As an important source of fresh water, the Mooren River Run is also an important source of food for many of the beasts and monstrosities that call the forest home.

##### Environment
In the spring, snowmelt from the [Alabaster Sierras](alabaster-sierra-range) cause the river to swell and the already fast-moving river becomes a torrent.

In the winter, the **frigid water** rarely freezes over due to the strong current, but when it does, the ice is thin and dangerous to walk on.

##### Foraging
^Food:^ **^Abundant^** ^-^ ^Water:^ **^Abundant^**

The cold, crystal clear [Mooren River Run](upper-mooren-river-run) is an important source of fresh water for the entire region and is home to various species of freshwater fish.

##### Travel
While the river is navigable by canoe or kayak, the trip is dangerous with numerous rapids and falls. Few are willing to brave the river and forest to save a few days.

The Illusory Barrier is collection of five obelisks around the city of [Whitestone](whitestone) designed to shield the city from above. When all five obelisks are powered by arcane energy, at the same time, they create a dome-like illusion causing the city to appear as unspoiled wilderness from above.

**Powering the Barrier**. An arcane spellcaster must expend 1 spell slot for 2 hours of illusion in each obelisk. Multiple casters are recommended due to the geographic dispersion and toll it takes on the casters. For every spell level sacrificed within a 24 hour period, the caster suffers 1 point of exhaustion.

##### Occupants
These locations do not have permanent staff or residents and are only used in times of need.

#### Ziggurat of Whitestone
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Alabaster^ ^Sierras^](alabaster-sierras) ^>^ [^Whitestone^](whitestone)

The Ziggurat of Whitestone is an ancient temple to **Ioun the Knowing Mistress** that was coated in [residuum](/item/residuum) and corrupted by the Briarwoods to aid in the acension of **Vecna the Whispered One** to godhood. 

The Ziggurat was once a great temple to **Ioun the Knowing Mistress**, but exactly when it was constructed is unknown. During the Calamity, the temple was the location of a terrible battle between **Tharizdun the Chained Oblivion** and **Ioun** in which she was very nearly fatally wounded. After the battle, the temple sank into the ground and was forgotten, by all but **Pelor the Dawn Father**. He planted the [Sun Tree](sun-tree) directly above the ziggurat to mark its location and honor her valor.

Located in the heart of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei), the Dividing Plains is a wide open grassland that stretches from the [Bladeshimmer Shoreline](bladeshimmer-shoreline) in the west to the [Lucidian Coast](lucidian-coast) in the east. The rolling pastoral hills and plains are a sharp contrast to the towering peaks of the [Cliffkeep Mountains](cliffkeep-mountains) to the north and the lush forest of the [Verdant Expanse](verdant-expanse) to the south.

In addition to being the bread basket of the continent, the Dividing Plains serves as the economic backbone of the three dominant civilizations on [Tal'Dorei](taldorei). The dwarven stronghold of Kraghammer, elven kingdom of Syngorn and the human Republic of Tal'Dorei depend on the region's network of roads for trade.

##### Climate
Located in the central, temperate region of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei), the Dividing Plains has a ***humid continental climate (Dfa)*** with hot summers and cold winters. Precipitation is consistent year-round and snowfall substantial in the winter months.

## Rifenmist Peninsula
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei)

^Area:^ **^136,395^ ^sq^ ^mi^** ^-^ ^Population:^ **^235,290^**

Named for the massive tropical rainforest that covers nearly two-thirds of the region, the Rifenmist Peninsula holds much more than its namesake. To the north of the jungle lies the rolling plains of the Mornset Countryside, a wide-open buffer between the temperate [Verdant Expanse](verdant-expanse) and the tropical Rifenmist Jungle.

To the south of the jungle, the land rises steadily until it reaches the dry and rocky Beynsfal Plateau. As if the harsh, unforgiving landsape were not enough, the plateau is home to the militaristic city-states of the hobgoblin empire, the Iron Authority.

##### Climate
The Rifenmist Peninsula is a complex region with multiple climates. The jungle is a **tropical rainforest (Af)** that is hot, humid and has an over-abundance of rain year-round. In the north, the Mornset Countryside is a **tropical savanna (As)** with moderately cooler temperatures and significantly less rainfall in the summer months. While to the south, the Beynsfal Plateau has a **hot-summer mediterranean (Csa)** climate that is hotter and drier than the rest of the region.

##### Demographics
While the Rifenmist Peninsula is heavily populated, the majority of the people in the region live in the city-states of the Iron Authority on the Beynsfal Plateau. The city-states are predominantly goblinoid, with hobgoblins exercising almost total control over all other peoples. The rest of the region is much more open and diverse, but the various tribes and communities of the Rifenmist Jungle and Mornset Countryside are wary of outsiders.

## Stormcrest Mountains
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei)

^Area:^ **^70,146^ ^sq^ ^mi^** ^-^ ^Population:^ **^8,890^**

The Stormcrest Mountains is the smallest region on the continent of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei) and also the least populated. Located on the eastern shore of the continent, the region is tucked into a small pocket of land between the [Lucidian Coast](lucidian-coast) to the north, the [Rifenmist Peninsula](rifenmist-peninsula) to the south, and the [Verdant Expanse](verdant-expanse) to the west.

Named for the storm-plagued mountains of the same name, the region is arguably better known for the massive Dreamseep Marshlands that collect the runoff from the Stormcrests and slowly drain southward into the Kirmont Bay.

##### Climate
While the climate in the mountains is considerably cooler than it is down in the Kirmont Valley, the region is most widely known for the **humid subtropical (Cfa)** climate of the expansive Dreamseep Marshlands. The region is also well-known for the violent storms that rage across the peaks and drop a significant amount of water down the southern slope.

##### Demographics
Above ground, the region is largely rural and very sparsely populated. The village of Bronbog is predominantly human, but the wilds of the Dreamseep and mountains are home to a number of kobold, lizardfolk, and orc tribes. Beneath the surface, the city of Ruhn-Shak is almost exclusively drow.

[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei)

^Area:^ **^101,322^ ^sq^ ^mi^** ^-^ ^Population:^ **^57,649^**

Home to the elven kingdom of Syngorn, the Verdant Expanse is a large, temperate forest that stretches from the [Stormcrest](stormcrest-mountains) and Stormpoint mountains in the east and follows the [Feshun River to the [Ozmit Sea](ozmit-sea) in the west. 

While the elves of Syngorn have enjoyed centuries of peace with the human Republic of Tal'Dorei, the Verdant Guard watch their northern borders with the [Bladeshimmer Shoreline](bladeshimmer-shoreline) and [Dividing Plains](dividing-plains) as closely as their border with the lawless [Rifenmist Peninsula](rifenmist-peninsula) to the south.

##### Climate
The Verdant Expanse has a **Humid subtropical (Cfa)** climate with hot, humid summers and generally cool winters. The region receives a good deal of rain year round.
