# Tal'Dorei
The continent of Tal'Dorei is located in the heart of [Exandria](exandria), nestled between the continents of [Issylra](Issylra) to the west and [Wildemount](wildemount) to the east. While not as large as [Issylra](Issylra) or as populous as [Wildemount](wildemount), [Tal'Dorei](taldorei) is growing quickly.  The slowest to recover following the Calamity, Tal'Dorei has made up for lost time and is growing in population, wealth and power.

##### Regions
The continent of Tal'Dorei is divided into the following eight regions:
- [Alabaster Sierras](alabaster-sierras)
- [Bladeshimmer Shoreline](bladeshimmer-shoreline)
- [Cliffkeep Mountains](cliffkeep-mountains)
- [Dividing Plains](dividing-plains)
- [Lucidian Coast](lucidian-coast)
- [Rifenmist Peninsula](rifenmist-peninsula)
- [Stormcrest Mountains](stormcrest-mountains)
- [Verdant Expanse](verdant-expanse)

## Alabaster Sierras
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei)

^Area:^ **^137,181^ ^sq^ ^mi^** ^-^ ^Population:^ **^333,268^**

The Alabaster Sierras are a wild, untamed wilderness tucked into the northeast corner of the continent of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei). While the region is named for the chalk-white [mountains](alabaster-sierra-range) that form the region's spine, it is the massive [Parchwood Timberland](parchwood-timberland) that dominates the region.

The region is bordered by the [Dividing Plains](dividing-plains) to the south and the icy [Frigid Depths](frigid-depths) to the east and north. Across the [Dawnmist Bay](dawnmist-bay) to the west are the [Cliffkeep Mountains](cliffkeep-mountains).

##### Demographics
The demographics below reflect the people of [Whitestone](whitestone) and the surrounding villages only. While the region appears largely human, there are sizable populations of giants, goblins, kobolds, orcs, and centaurs residing throughout the [Alabaster Sierras](alabaster-sierra-range) and [Parchwood Timberland](parchwood-timberland). An accurate count for everyone simply is not possible.

Likewise, tribes of centaurs, gnolls, goliaths, and orcs wander the plains, never staying in one place too long.

## Rifenmist Peninsula
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei)

^Area:^ **^311,775^ ^sq^ ^mi^** ^-^ ^Population:^ **^162,855^**

Located at the far southern tip of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei) is the region known as the [Rifenmist Peninsula](rifenmist-peninsula). Named for the massive [tropical rainforest](rifenmist-peninsula) that covers nearly two-thirds of the region. To the north lies the rolling grasslands of the [Mornset Countryside](mornset-countryside) and the souther boundaries of the [Verdant Expanse](verdant-expanse).

Pushing southward through the [jungle](rifenmist-jungle) the ground rises steadily until it reaches the high, arid [Beynsfal Plateau](beynsdal-plateau). Home to the militaristic city-states of the hobgoblin empire, known as the Iron Authority.

##### Climate
The climate of the Rifenmist Peninsula varies widely across the region. While the [Beynsfal Plateau](beynsfal-plateau) is hot and arid with very little rainfall, the [Rifenmist Jungle](rifenmist-jungle) is hot and humid with an over abundance of precipitation. To the north of the jungle, the [Mornset Countryside](mornset-countryside) is cooler than the rest of the region, with weather more comparable to the [Verdant Expanse](verdant-expanse) to the north.

*Note: The majority of the Rifenmist Peninsula lies in the southern hemisphere. The summer months are Duscar, Horisal, and Misuthar.*
