# Tal'Dorei
The continent of Tal'Dorei is located in the heart of [Exandria](exandria), nestled between the continents of [Issylra](Issylra) to the west and [Wildemount](wildemount) to the east. While not as large as [Issylra](Issylra) or as populous as [Wildemount](wildemount), [Tal'Dorei](taldorei) is growing quickly.  The slowest to recover following the Calamity, Tal'Dorei has made up for lost time and is growing in population, wealth and power.

##### Regions
The continent of Tal'Dorei is divided into the following eight regions:
- [Alabaster Sierras](alabaster-sierras)
- [Bladeshimmer Shoreline](bladeshimmer-shoreline)
- [Cliffkeep Mountains](cliffkeep-mountains)
- [Dividing Plains](dividing-plains)
- [Lucidian Coast](lucidian-coast)
- [Rifenmist Peninsula](rifenmist-peninsula)
- [Stormcrest Mountains](stormcrest-mountains)
- [Verdant Expanse](verdant-expanse)

## Alabaster Sierras
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei)

^Area:^ **^63,911^ ^sq^ ^mi^** ^-^ ^Population:^ **^5,288^**

Located in the northeast corner of the continent, the Alabaster Sierras are named for the chalk-white [mountains](alabaster-sierra-range) that run the length of the Alabaster Peninsula. While named for the [Alabaster Sierra range](alabaster-sierra-range), it is the massive [Parchwood Timberland](parchwood-timberland) that truly dominates the region.

While the region is bordered to the south by the [Dividing Plains](dividing-plains) and the [Lucidian Coast](lucidian-coast), the rest of the region is surrounded by water. The [Alabaster Bay](alabaster-bay) and [Dawnmist Bay](dawnmist-bay) frame the main peninsula, while the [Shearing Channel](shearing-channel) and [Lucidian Ocean](lucidian-ocean) cut the region off from the continent of [Wildemount](wildemount) to the east.

##### Climate
The region has a **humid continental climate (Dfb)** with long, cold winters with plenty of snowfall. Summers are warm, but short with a fair amount of rain.

## Bladeshimmer Shoreline
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei)

^Area:^ **^98,204^ ^sq^ ^mi^** ^-^ ^Population:^ **^433,593^**

The Bladeshimmer Shoreline is located on the central, western coast of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei) and stretches some one thousand miles from the [Seashale Mountains](seashale-mountains) in the north to the [Daggerbay Mountains](daggerbay-mountains) and [Visa Isles](visa-isle) in the south. With the [Ozmit Sea](ozmit-sea) to its west, the Bladeshimmer extends inland as far as the [Ironseat Ridge](ironseat-ridge) before giving way to the [Dividing Plains](dividing-plains) of central [Tal'Dorei](taldorei).

While the Bladeshimmer Shoreline is one of the smaller regions on the continent, it is by far the most powerful both politically and economically. Home to the city of [Emon](emon), the region's success depends almost entirely on the fortune of the city and the stewardship of the Council of Tal'Dorei.

##### Climate

The Cliffkeep Mountains is the largest region in all of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei) and occupies the northern third of the continent. Virtually all of which is dominated by various mountain ranges that make up the [mountain range](cliffkeep-mountain-range) of the same name. 

The region stretches from the [Ozmit Sea](ozmit-sea) on [Tal'Dorei's](taldorei) northwestern shores to the [Dawnmist Bay](dawnmist-bay) that separates it from the [Alabaster Sierras](alabaster-sierras) to the east. To the north lies the frozen waters of the [Frigid Depths](frigid-depths) while the temperate [Bladeshimmer Shoreline](bladeshimmer-shoreline) and [Dividing Plains](dividing-plains) of central [Tal'Dorei](taldorei) to the south.

Located in the heart of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei), the Dividing Plains is a wide open grassland that stretches from the [Bladeshimmer Shoreline](bladeshimmer-shoreline) in the west to the [Lucidian Coast](lucidian-coast) in the east. The rolling pastoral hills and plains are a sharp contrast to the towering peaks of the [Cliffkeep Mountains](cliffkeep-mountains) to the north and the lush forest of the [Verdant Expanse](verdant-expanse) to the south.

In addition to being the bread basket of the continent, the Dividing Plains serves as the economic backbone of the three dominant civilizations on [Tal'Dorei](taldorei). The dwarven stronghold of [Kraghammer](kraghammer), elven kingdom of [Syngorn](syngorn) and the human Republic of Tal'Dorei depend on the region's network of roads for trade.

Located on the east coast of [Tal'Dorei](tal'dorei), the Lucidian Coast stretches from the base of the [Parchwood Timberland](parchwood-timberland) in the north to the [Owlset Bay](owlset-bay) at the eastern end of the [Stormcrest Mountains](stormcrest-mountains) in the south. Inland, the region extends as far as the western slope of the [Summit Peaks](summit-peaks) where it meets the central [Dividing Plains](dividing-plains).

Home to the port cities of [Stilben](stilben) and [Drynna](drynna), the [Lucidian Coast](lucidian-coast) is an important source of trade with the eastern continent of [Wildemount](wildemount) and the lucrative ports on the [Menagerie Coast](menagerie-coast).

## Rifenmist Peninsula
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei)

^Area:^ **^136,395^ ^sq^ ^mi^** ^-^ ^Population:^ **^235,290^**

Named for the massive [tropical rainforest](rifenmist-peninsula) that covers nearly two-thirds of the region, the Rifenmist Peninsula holds much more than its namesake. To the north of the jungle lies the rolling plains of the [Mornset Countryside](mornset-countryside), a wide-open buffer between the temperate [Verdant Expanse](verdant-expanse) and the tropical [Rifenmist Jungle](rifenmist-jungle).

To the south of the [jungle](rifenmist-jungle), the land rises steadily until it reaches the dry and rocky [Beynsfal Plateau](beynsfal-plateau). As if the harsh, unforgiving landsape were not enough, the plateau is home to the militaristic city-states of the hobgoblin empire, the Iron Authority.

##### Climate
The Rifenmist Peninsula is a complex region with multiple climates. The [jungle](rifenmist-jungle) is a **tropical rainforest (Af)** that is hot, humid and has an over-abundance of rain year-round. In the north, the [Mornset Countryside](mornset-countryside) is a **tropical savanna (As)** with moderately cooler temperatures and significantly less rainfall in the summer months. While to the south, the [Beynsfal Plateau](beynsfal-plateau) has a **hot-summer mediterranean (Csa)** climate that is hotter and drier than the rest of the region.

*^Climate^ ^for^ ^the^ ^Beyndfal^ ^Plateau^ ^near^ ^Tz'Arrm^.*

##### Demographics
While the Rifenmist Peninsula is heavily popultaed, the majority of the people in the region live in the city-states of the Iron Authority on the [Beynsfal Plateau](beynsfal-plateau). The city-states are predominantly goblinoid, with hobgoblins exercising almost total control over all other peoples. The rest of the region is much more open and diverse, but the various tribes and communities of the [Rifenmist Jungle](rifenmist-jungle) and [Mornset Countryside](mornset-countryside) are wary of outsiders.

## Stormcrest Mountains
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei)

^Area:^ **^70,146^ ^sq^ ^mi^** ^-^ ^Population:^ **^8,890^**

The Stormcrest Mountains is the smallest region on the continent of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei) and also the least populated. Located on the eastern shore of the continent, the region is tucked into a small pocket of land between the [Lucidian Coast](lucidian-coast) to the north, the [Rifenmist Peninsula](rifenmist-peninsula) to the south, and the [Verdant Expanse](verdant-expanse) to the west.

Named for the storm-plagued [mountains](stormcrest-mountains) of the same name, the region is arguably better known for the massive [Dreamseep Marshlands](dreamseep-marshlands) that collect the runoff from the [Stormcrests](stormcrest-mountains) and slowly drain southward into the [Kirmont Bay](kirmont-bay).

##### Climate
While the climate in the mountains is considerably cooler than it is down in the [Kirmont Valley](kirmont-valley), the region is most widely known for the **humid subtropical (Cfa)** climate of the expansive [Dreamseep Marshlands](dreamseep-marshlands). The region is also well-known for the violent storms that rage across the peaks and drop a significant amount of water down the southern slope.

##### Demographics
Above ground, the region is largely rural and very sparsely populated. The village of [Bronbog](bronbog) is predominantly human, but the wilds of the [Dreamseep](dreamseep-marshlands) and [mountains](stormcrest-mountains) are home to a number of kobold, lizardfolk, and orc tribes. Beneath the surface, the city of [Ruhn-Shak](ruhn-shak) is almost exclusively drow.

## Verdant Expanse
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei)

^Area:^ **^101,322^ ^sq^ ^mi^** ^-^ ^Population:^ **^57,649^**

Home to the elven kingdom of [Syngorn](syngorn), the Verdant Expanse is a large, temperate forest that stretches from the [Stormcrest](stormcrest-mountains) and [Stormpoint](stormpoint-mountains) mountains in the east and follows the [Feshun River](feshun-river) to the [Ozmit Sea](ozmit-sea) in the west. 

While the elves of [Syngorn](syngorn) have enjoyed centuries of peace with the human Republic of Tal'Dorei, the Verdant Guard watch their northern borders with the [Bladeshimmer Shoreline](bladeshimmer-shoreline) and [Dividing Plains](dividing-plains) as closely as their border with the lawless [Rifenmist Peninsula](rifenmist-peninsula) to the south.

##### Climate
The Verdant Expanse has a **Humid subtropical (Cfa)** climate with hot, humid summers and generally cool winters. The region receives a good deal of rain year round.
