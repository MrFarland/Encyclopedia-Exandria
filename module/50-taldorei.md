# Tal'Dorei
The continent of Tal'Dorei is located in the heart of [Exandria](exandria), nestled between the continents of [Issylra](Issylra) to the west and [Wildemount](wildemount) to the east. While not as large as [Issylra](Issylra) or as populous as [Wildemount](wildemount), [Tal'Dorei](taldorei) is growing quickly.  The slowest to recover following the Calamity, Tal'Dorei has made up for lost time and is growing in population, wealth and power.

##### Regions
The continent of Tal'Dorei is divided into the following eight regions:
- [Alabaster Sierras](alabaster-sierras)
- [Bladeshimmer Shoreline](bladeshimmer-shoreline)
- [Cliffkeep Mountains](cliffkeep-mountains)
- [Dividing Plains](dividing-plains)
- [Lucidian Coast](lucidian-coast)
- [Rifenmist Peninsula](rifenmist-peninsula)
- [Stormcrest Mountains](stormcrest-mountains)
- [Verdant Expanse](verdant-expanse)

## Alabaster Sierras
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei)

^Area:^ **^63,911^ ^sq^ ^mi^** ^-^ ^Population:^ **^5,288^**

Located in the northeast corner of the continent, the Alabaster Sierras are named for the chalk-white mountains that run the length of the Alabaster Peninsula. While named for the Alabaster Sierra range, it is the massive Parchwood Timberland that truly dominates the region.

The region is bordered by the [Dividing Plains](dividing-plains) and [Lucidian Coast](lucidian-coast) to the south and by water to the east, north, and west. The Alabaster and [Dawnmist Bay](dawnmist-bay)s frame the peninsula and the [Shearing Channel](shearing-channel) separates the region from the continent of [Wildemount](wildemount) to the east.

##### Climate
The region has a **humid continental climate (Dfb)** with long, cold winters with plenty of snowfall. Summers are warm, but short with a fair amount of rain.

## Bladeshimmer Shoreline
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei)

^Area:^ **^98,204^ ^sq^ ^mi^** ^-^ ^Population:^ **^433,593^**

The Bladeshimmer Shoreline is located on the central, western coast of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei) and stretches some one thousand miles from the Seashale Mountains in the north to the Daggerbay Mountains and Visa Isle in the south. With the [Ozmit Sea](ozmit-sea) to its west, the Bladeshimmer extends inland as far as the Ironseat Ridge before giving way to the [Dividing Plains](dividing-plains) of central [Tal'Dorei](taldorei).

While the Bladeshimmer Shoreline is one of the smaller regions on the continent, it is by far the most powerful both politically and economically. Home to the city of Emon, the region's success depends almost entirely on the fortune of the city and the stewardship of the Council of Tal'Dorei.

##### Climate
The Bladeshimmer Shoreline has a **warm temperate oceanic (Cfb)** climate. It has cool, wet winters, and mild summers with a fair amount of precipitation.

To the north lies the frozen waters of the [Frigid Depths](frigid-depths) while the temperate [Bladeshimmer Shoreline](bladeshimmer-shoreline) and [Dividing Plains](dividing-plains) of central [Tal'Dorei](taldorei) to the south.

##### Climate
The Cliffkeep Mountains is a large region with a ***humid continental climate (Dwb)*** with warm summers and cold, dry winters in the south, and a ***subarctic climate (Dfc)*** with long, cold winters and brief, warm summers in the north.

## Dividing Plains
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei)

^Area:^ **^158,218^ ^sq^ ^mi^** ^-^ ^Population:^ **^114,201^**

Located in the heart of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei), the Dividing Plains is a wide open grassland that stretches from the [Bladeshimmer Shoreline](bladeshimmer-shoreline) in the west to the [Lucidian Coast](lucidian-coast) in the east. The rolling pastoral hills and plains are a sharp contrast to the towering peaks of the [Cliffkeep Mountains](cliffkeep-mountains) to the north and the lush forest of the [Verdant Expanse](verdant-expanse) to the south.

In addition to being the bread basket of the continent, the Dividing Plains serves as the economic backbone of the three dominant civilizations on [Tal'Dorei](taldorei). The dwarven stronghold of Kraghammer, elven kingdom of Syngorn and the human Republic of Tal'Dorei depend on the region's network of roads for trade.

##### Climate
Located in the central, temperate region of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei), the Dividing Plains has a ***humid continental climate (Dfa)*** with hot summers and cold winters. Precipitation is consistent year-round and snowfall substantial in the winter months.

Inland, the region extends as far as the western slope of the Summit Peaks where it meets the central [Dividing Plains](dividing-plains).

Home to the port cities of Stilben and Drynna, the [Lucidian Coast](lucidian-coast) is an important source of trade with the eastern continent of [Wildemount](wildemount) and the lucrative ports on the [Menagerie Coast](menagerie-coast).

##### Climate

## Rifenmist Peninsula
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei)

^Area:^ **^136,395^ ^sq^ ^mi^** ^-^ ^Population:^ **^235,290^**

Named for the massive tropical rainforest that covers nearly two-thirds of the region, the Rifenmist Peninsula holds much more than its namesake. To the north of the jungle lies the rolling plains of the Mornset Countryside, a wide-open buffer between the temperate [Verdant Expanse](verdant-expanse) and the tropical Rifenmist Jungle.

To the south of the jungle, the land rises steadily until it reaches the dry and rocky Beynsfal Plateau. As if the harsh, unforgiving landsape were not enough, the plateau is home to the militaristic city-states of the hobgoblin empire, the Iron Authority.

##### Climate
The Rifenmist Peninsula is a complex region with multiple climates. The jungle is a **tropical rainforest (Af)** that is hot, humid and has an over-abundance of rain year-round. In the north, the Mornset Countryside is a **tropical savanna (As)** with moderately cooler temperatures and significantly less rainfall in the summer months. While to the south, the Beynsfal Plateau has a **hot-summer mediterranean (Csa)** climate that is hotter and drier than the rest of the region.

##### Demographics
While the Rifenmist Peninsula is heavily populated, the majority of the people in the region live in the city-states of the Iron Authority on the Beynsfal Plateau. The city-states are predominantly goblinoid, with hobgoblins exercising almost total control over all other peoples. The rest of the region is much more open and diverse, but the various tribes and communities of the Rifenmist Jungle and Mornset Countryside are wary of outsiders.

## Stormcrest Mountains
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei)

^Area:^ **^70,146^ ^sq^ ^mi^** ^-^ ^Population:^ **^8,890^**

The Stormcrest Mountains is the smallest region on the continent of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei) and also the least populated. Located on the eastern shore of the continent, the region is tucked into a small pocket of land between the [Lucidian Coast](lucidian-coast) to the north, the [Rifenmist Peninsula](rifenmist-peninsula) to the south, and the [Verdant Expanse](verdant-expanse) to the west.

Named for the storm-plagued mountains of the same name, the region is arguably better known for the massive Dreamseep Marshlands that collect the runoff from the Stormcrests and slowly drain southward into the Kirmont Bay.

##### Climate
While the climate in the mountains is considerably cooler than it is down in the Kirmont Valley, the region is most widely known for the **humid subtropical (Cfa)** climate of the expansive Dreamseep Marshlands. The region is also well-known for the violent storms that rage across the peaks and drop a significant amount of water down the southern slope.

| Rain | 4.0" | 5.8" | 3.9" | 4.3" |
{.gray}

##### Demographics
Above ground, the region is largely rural and very sparsely populated. The village of Bronbog is predominantly human, but the wilds of the Dreamseep and mountains are home to a number of kobold, lizardfolk, and orc tribes. Beneath the surface, the city of Ruhn-Shak is almost exclusively drow.

[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei)

^Area:^ **^101,322^ ^sq^ ^mi^** ^-^ ^Population:^ **^57,649^**

Home to the elven kingdom of Syngorn, the Verdant Expanse is a large, temperate forest that stretches from the [Stormcrest](stormcrest-mountains) and Stormpoint mountains in the east and follows the [Feshun River to the [Ozmit Sea](ozmit-sea) in the west. 

While the elves of Syngorn have enjoyed centuries of peace with the human Republic of Tal'Dorei, the Verdant Guard watch their northern borders with the [Bladeshimmer Shoreline](bladeshimmer-shoreline) and [Dividing Plains](dividing-plains) as closely as their border with the lawless [Rifenmist Peninsula](rifenmist-peninsula) to the south.

##### Climate
The Verdant Expanse has a **Humid subtropical (Cfa)** climate with hot, humid summers and generally cool winters. The region receives a good deal of rain year round.
