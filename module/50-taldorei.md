# Tal'Dorei
The continent of Tal'Dorei is located in the heart of [Exandria](exandria), nestled between the continents of [Issylra](Issylra) to the west and [Wildemount](wildemount) to the east. While not as large as [Issylra](Issylra) or as populous as [Wildemount](wildemount), [Tal'Dorei](taldorei) is growing quickly.  The slowest to recover following the Calamity, Tal'Dorei has made up for lost time and is growing in population, wealth and power.

##### Regions
The continent of Tal'Dorei is divided into the following eight regions:
- [Alabaster Sierras](alabaster-sierras)
- [Bladeshimmer Shoreline](bladeshimmer-shoreline)
- [Cliffkeep Mountains](cliffkeep-mountains)
- [Dividing Plains](dividing-plains)
- [Lucidian Coast](lucidian-coast)
- [Rifenmist Peninsula](rifenmist-peninsula)

## Alabaster Sierras
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) {.screen-only}

The Alabaster Sierras are a wild, untamed wilderness tucked into the northeast corner of the continent of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei). While the region is named for the chalk-white [mountains](alabaster-sierra-range) that form the region's spine, it is the massive [Parchwood Timberland](parchwood-timberland) that dominates the region.

The region is bordered by the [Dividing Plains](dividing-plains) to the south and the icy [Frigid Depths](frigid-depths) to the east and north. Across the [Dawnmist Bay](dawnmist-bay) to the west are the [Cliffkeep Mountains](cliffkeep-mountains).

### Alabaster Bay
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Alabaster^ ^Sierras^](alabaster-sierras) {.screen-only}

^Area:^ **^xx,xxx^ ^sq.mi.^** ^-^ ^Type:^ **^Coastal^** ^-^ ^Danger:^ **^Medium^**

The Alabaster Bay is a large bay located on the east side of the [Alabaster Peninsula](alabaster-sierras) and west of the [Shearing Channel](shearing-channel). While not as rough as the open waters of the [Frigid Depths](frigid-depths), the Alabaster Bay offers very little protection from the brutal storms that plague, [Exandria's](exandria) northern ocean.

##### Flora & Fauna
^Food:^ **^Abundant^** ^-^ ^Water:^ **^Limited^**

The Alabaster Bay is a rich ecosystem both above and below the waterline. Numerous types of seaweed line the bottom of the bay and provide excellent refuge for the numerous species of fish that call the bay home.

A number of marine mammals also reside in the bay. Colonies of seals can be found all along the western shore, as can the [sea lions](/monster/sea-lion) and [killer whales](/monster/killer-whale) that hunt them. Beneath the surface, [giant crabs](/monster/giant-crab) and [chuul](/monster/chuul) that prowl the bay's floor.

##### Resources
While rich in fish and crabs, the bay's location makes it impractical for fishers out of [Whitestone](whitestone) or the [Menagerie Coast](menagerie-coast) to work.

##### Settlements
There are no known settlements on the bay.

### Alabaster Sierra Range
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Alabaster^ ^Sierras^](alabaster-sierras) {.screen-only}

^Area:^ **^xx,xxx^ ^sq.mi.^** ^-^ ^Type:^ **^Mountain^** ^-^ ^Danger:^ **^High^**

Named for their chalk-white color, the mountains of the Alabaster Sierras stretch over three hundred miles along the eastern edge of the [Alabaster Peninsula](alabaster-sierras). The mountains rise out of the [Parchwood Timberland](parchwood-timberland) in the south, run along the western shore of the [Alabaster Bay](alabaster-bay), and wrap around the northern tip to form the towering cliffs of the [Salted Bluffs](salted-bluffs). 

##### Flora & Fauna
^Food:^ **^Limited^** ^-^ ^Water:^ **^Abundant^**

The Sierras are tall, jagged peaks that are capped with snow year-round. The lower elevations overlap with the lush [Parchwood Timberland](parchwood-timberland), while the upper elevations become increasingly more barren.

In addition to the typical beasts found in higher elevations, the Sierras are native to a number of dangerous monsters including [behirs](/monster/behir), [harpies](/monster/harpy), and [wyverns](/monster/wyvern).

##### Resources
While the Alabaster Sierras are a good source of mineral deposits, it the [white stone](/item/white-stone) from which the mountains get their name is their most valuable resource. Infused with arcane energy, "white stone" and the green, glass-like [residuum](/item/residuum) it can be refined into are lucrative exports and an important source of income for the entire region.

##### Settlements
While largely untamed wilderness, minor settlements and camps are scattered throughout the mountain range. The people of [Whitestone](whitestone) do not venture to far into the mountains to establish mines and quarries, but they occassionally encroach on the lands of various [giant](/monster/stone-giant), [goblin](/monster/goblin) and [kobold](/monster/kobold) tribes in the upper Sierras.

### Alabaster Trail
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Alabaster^ ^Sierras^](alabaster-sierras) {.screen-only}

^Distance:^ **^360^ ^mi.^** ^-^ **^Type:^** ^Forest^ ^-^ **^Danger:^** ^Very^ ^High^

The Alabaster Trail is the only road that connects the city of [Whitestone](whitestone) at the northern tip of the [Alabaster Peninsula](alabaster-sierras) to the rest of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei). It winds southward for a little more than 360 miles through the [Parchwood Timberland](parchwood-timberland) to the town of [Turst Fields](turst-fields) in the eastern [Dividing Plains](dividing-plains).

(print-column)

##### Security
Travel on the trail is extremely dangerous. While the northern and southern ends are well patrolled by the Pale Guard and Shields of the Plains respectively, travelers attempting the journey are advised to travel by caravan. 

[Bandits](/monster/bandit), [gnolls](/monster/gnoll) and [orcs](/monster/orcs) are a constant threat on the southern end of the trail, but even they avoid the stretch through the forest. Lycans, dire beasts, and undead are an ever-present threat on the road through the [Parchwood](parchwood-timberland).

### Dawnmist Bay
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Alabaster^ ^Sierras^](alabaster-sierras) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Coastal^ ^&^ ^Forest^ ^-^ **^Danger:^** ^Low^

Located on the western side of the [Alabaster Peninsula](alabaster-sierras), the Dawnmist Bay is a large, sheltered bay that drives deep into the continent of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei) . While the bay is an extension of the [Frigid Depths](frigid-depths), the Dawnmist is warmer and calmer than it's sister, the [Alabaster Bay](alabaster-bay) on the other side of the peninsula. 

Named for the heavy banks of fog that roll off the eastern slope of the [Cliffkeep Mountains](cliffkeep-mountain-range) to the west, the Dawnmist Bay, like the nearby [forest](dawnmist-pine) of the same name, is often obscured by a thick fog well into midday.

##### Flora & Fauna
^Food:^ **^Abundant^** ^-^ ^Water:^ **^Abundant^**

The Dawnmist Bay has a thriving marine ecosystem. Numerous species of seaweed and fish thrive in the isolated bay. To cold for sharks and very litte boat traffic has made the bay an ideal breeding ground for various types of whales.

##### Settlements
There are number of small fishing villages along the eastern shore of the Dawnmist Bay and they've become an important source of food for the city of [Whitestone](whitestone) and [Turst Fields](turst-fields).

### Parchwood Bay
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Alabaster^ ^Sierras^](alabaster-sierras)

**^Type:^** ^Coastal^ ^&^ ^Forest^ ^-^ **^Danger:^** ^High^

The Parchwood Bay is a large, island-choked bay that forms the western side of the perilous [Shearing Channel](shearing-channel) that separates the continents of [Tal'Dorei](tal'dorei) and [Wildemount](wildemount).

While the bay seems like a great place to ride out one of the many storms that plague the [channel](shearing-channel), it is not without it's dangers. The bay is a maze of heavily [forested](parchwood-timberland) islands and rocky shoals that make navigating difficult in even the best of conditions. 


##### Flora & Fauna
^Food:^ **^Abundant^** ^-^ ^Water:^ **^Abundant^**

Like the surrounding [Parchwood Timberland](parchwood-timberland), the Parchwood Bay is teeming with life. The majority of the islands in the bay are heavily forested with a mixture of evergreen and deciduous trees. 

Like the nearby Parchwood, the bay is also cursed with lycanthropy and undeath. Crew unlucky enough to survive a shipwreck are often beset and turned by the inhabitants of the forest.

##### Settlements
While there are no known, permanent settlements in the area many tribes of [lizardfolk](/monster/lizardfolk), [orcs](/monster/orc) and [gnolls](/monster/gnoll) live along it's shores and on some of the more remote islands in the bay.

### Parchwood Timberland
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Alabaster^ ^Sierras^](alabaster-sierras)

**^Type:^** ^Forest^ ^-^ **^Danger:^** ^Very^ ^High^

While named for the chalk-white mountains, the Parchwood Timberland dominates the [Alabaster Sierra region](alabaster-sierras) and most of northeast [Tal'Dorei](tal'dorei). It stretches from the [Dawnmist Bay](dawnmist-bay) in the west to the [Shearing Channel](shearing-channel) and [Lucidian Ocean](lucidian-ocean) in the east. To the south, the Parchwood marks the border between the wilderness of the [Alabaster Sierras](alabaster-sierras) and the more "civilized" [Dividing Plains](dividing-plains) and [Lucidian Coast](lucidian-coast) of eastern [Tal'Dorei](taldorei.)

(page-column)

##### Flora & Fauna
^Food:^ **^Abundant^** ^-^ ^Water:^ **^Abundant^**

The Parchwood Timberland is a large, boreal coniferous forest with massive pines, spruces, and redwoods mixed with deciduous oaks, maples and birches. The underbrush is thick, tangled, and comprised of hardy bushes and plants that have adapted to the harsh winters of northeast [Tal'Dorei](taldorei).

An extremely dangerous forest, the Parchwood is crawling with dire beasts, lycans, corrupted plant-life and undead. 

##### Resources
Wild game and timber are harvested heavily along the forest's southern border by the people of [Turst Fields](turst-fields) and [Drynna](drynna); and by the people of [Whitestone](whitestone) far to the north.

##### Settlements
While the city of [Whitestone](whitestone) and it's surrounding villages are the largest settlements in the Parchwood, numerous tribes of [orcs](/monster/orc), [gnolls](/monster/gnoll), and [centaurs](/monster/centaur) have camps and semi-permanent settlements throughout the southern Parchwood.
