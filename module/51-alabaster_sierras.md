## Alabaster Sierras
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) {.screen-only}

^Area:^ **^137,181^ ^sq^ ^mi^** ^-^ ^Population:^ **^4,865^**

The Alabaster Sierras are a wild, untamed wilderness tucked into the northeast corner of the continent of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei). While the region is named for the chalk-white [mountains](alabaster-sierra-range) that run through the heart of the region, it is dominated by the massive forest known as the [Parchwood Timberland](parchwood-timberland).

#### Climate
The [Alabaster Sierras](alabaster-sierras) have a **humid continental climate (Dfb)**. The winter is long and cold, and snowfall is common from late fall to early spring. The summers are warm, but relatively short with a fair amount of rain.

Compared to the other regions of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei), only the jungles of the [Rifenmist Peninsula](rifenmist-peninsula) receive more rainfall annually.

#### Demographics
| Race       |  % | Race      |  % |
|:-----------|:--:|:----------|:--:|
| Human      | 68 | Elf       |  6 |
| Halfling   |  7 | -         |    |
| Dwarf      |  7 | Other     |    |

The numbers above represent the region's only permanent settlement of [Whitestone](whitestone) and it's surrounding villages. They do not account for the many indigenous tribes that live deep within the [Parchwood Timberland](parchwood-timberland).

#### Economy
While rich in natural resources like stone and timber, the economy of the [Alabaster Sierras](alabaster-sierras) reolves around the magically infused "whitestone" that gives the [Alabaster Sierras](alabaster-sierra-range) their distinctive color.

#### Geography
The following features are located in this region:

- [Alabaster Bay](alabaster-bay)
- [Alabaster Sierras](alabaster-sierra-range)
- [Alabaster Trail](alabaster-trail)
- [Dawnmist Bay](dawnmist-bay)
- [Parchwood Bay](parchwood-bay)
- [Parchwood Timberland](parchwood-timberland)
- [Salted Bluffs](salted-bluffs)
- [Shearing Channel](shearing-channel)
- [Upper Mooren River Run](upper-mooren-river-run)

#### Government
While much of the [Alabaster Sierras](alabaster-sierras) is untamed wilderness, the city of [Whitestone](whitestone) and surrounding settlements fall under the protection of the **House of de Rolo** and the **Chamber of Whitestone**. 

[Whitestone](whitestone) maintains a cordial relationship with the **House of Tal'Dorei** in [Emon](emon), the city is largely isolated from the rest of the continent geographically and politically.

#### Religion
The dominant relgions in the region are the Prime Deities of **Pelor** and **Erathis**, but worshippers of **Avandra**, **Moradin**, **Melora** and **Corellon** are common as well.

Many of the indigenous Gnoll and Orc tribes in the southern [Parchwood](parchwood) are adherent followers of **Yeenoghu** and **Gruumsh** respectively and should be given a wide berth.

#### Settlements
The following settlements are located in this region:

### Alabaster Bay
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Alabaster^ ^Sierras^](alabaster-sierras) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Arctic,^ ^Coastal,^ ^&^ ^Underwater^

The Alabaster Bay is a large bay located on the eastern side of the [Alabaster Peninsula](alabaster-peninsula) in northeastern [Tal'Dorei](taldorei). Located on the northern end of the [Shearing Channel](shearing-channel), few vessels enter the bay, with most shipping turning east along the [Stonecage Cliffs](stonecage-cliffs) and northern coast of [Wildemount](wildemount) to the port of [Icehaven](icehaven) and the island of [Eiselcross](eiselcross).

The western shore of the bay is rocky and cold. The [Alabaster Sierras](alabaster-sierra-range) rise out of the water and shoot upward forming the eastern slope of the jagged peaks. The southern shore, on the other hand, is relatively flat with the [Parchwood Timberland](parchwood-timberland) coming right up to the water's edge.

The icy waters of the Alabaster Bay are home to large colonies of seals and is a favorite hunting ground for sea lions and [killer whales](/monster/killer-whale). While most of the marine life keeps to itself, there are tales of [Chuul](/monster/chull) attacking seal hunters and fishers working the bay.

### Alabaster Sierra Range
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Alabaster^ ^Sierras^](alabaster-sierras) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Mountain^

Named for their chalk-white color, the mountains of the [Alabaster Sierras](alabaster-sierra-range) stretch over three hundred miles along the eastern edge of the [Alabaster Peninsula](alabaster-sierras). They emerge from the [Parchwood Timberland](parchwood-timberland) in the south and run along the western shore of the [Alabaster Bay](alabaster-bay) before coming to an abrupt end at the towering [Salted Bluffs](salted-bluffs). 

Infused with magical energy, the white stone from which the mountains get their name is a hot commodity in arcane circles. While the raw stone has some magical properties, it's arcane power is greatly enhanced once it has been refined into a green glass-like substance called [residuum](/item/residuum). It is a lucrative export for the city of [Whitestone](whitestone) and numerous quarries dot the northern end of the Alabaster Sierras.

While not nearly as large as the massive [Cliffkeeps](cliffkeep-mountain-range) to the west, the [Alabaster Sierras](alabaster-sierras) are tall, jagged peaks crawling with monsters. [Behirs](/monster/behir), [harpies](/monster/harpy), and [wyverns](/monster/wyvern) all call the mountains home, as do some [stone giant](/monster/stone-giant) clans.

### Alabaster Trail
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Alabaster^ ^Sierras^](alabaster-sierras) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Forest^

The [Alabaster Trail](alabaster-trail) is the only road linking the city of [Whitestone](whitestone) in northeastern [Tal'Dorei](taldorei) to the rest of the continent. It stretches a little under 360 miles from [Whitestone](whitestone) in the north to the town of [Turst Fields](turst-fields) in the eastern [Dividing Plains](dividing-plains).

The Trail is a dangerous road. The northern and southern ends are well patroled by the [Paleguard](paleguard) and [Shields of the Plains](shields-of-the-plains), but the majority of the road winds through the dark and dangerous [Parchwood Timberland](parchwood-timberland).

[Bandits](/monster/bandit), [gnolls](/monster/gnoll) and [orcs](/monster/orcs) are a constant threat on the southern end, but even they avoid the stretch through the forest. Dire beasts and undead creatures have been known to harass travelers along the road.

### Dawnmist Bay
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Alabaster^ ^Sierras^](alabaster-sierras) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Coastal^ ^&^ ^Underwater^

Located on the western side of the [Alabaster Peninsula](alabaster-sierras), the [Dawnmist Bay](dawnmist-bay) is a large, sheltered bay that drives deep into the continent of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei). While it is an extension of the [Frigid Depths](frigid-depths), the [Dawnmist](dawnmist-bay) is warmer and calmer than it's sister, the [Alabaster Bay](alabaster-bay) on the other side of the peninsula. 

Named for the heavy banks of fog that roll off the eastern slope of the [Cliffkeep Mountains](cliffkeep-mountain-range), the [Dawnmist Bay](dawnmist-bay) and its namesake forest, the [Dawnmist Pines](dawnmist-pines) are often obscured by light fog. Only during the warm months of summer does the fog burn off by midday.

### Parchwood Bay
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Alabaster^ ^Sierras^](alabaster-sierras) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Coastal^ ^&^ ^Underwater^

Located on the western side of the [Shearing Channel](shearing-channel), the [Parchwood Bay](parchwood-bay) 

At first glance, the [Parchwood Bay](parchwood-bay) seems like a good place for ships to ride out one of the many storms that plague the perilous [Shearing Channel](shearing-channel). The hundreds of islands and hidden coves provide 

Unfortunately for many a captain, ships can easily become lost in the maze of islands and wreck on any of the numerous rocky shoals that hide beneath the surface of the deceptively calm waters of the bay.

### Parchwood Timberland
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Alabaster^ ^Sierras^](alabaster-sierras) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Forest^

Dominating the northeastern corner of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei) is the dark and dense Parchwood Timberland. A massive forest, wild, untamed, and largely unexplored. Few dare to stray from the [Alabaster Trail](alabaster-trail) travelling between [Whitestone](whitestone) and [Turst Fields](turst-fields) and many who do are never seen again.

The Parchwood Timberland is an extremely dangerous forest that teems with monstrosities, undead, lycans, and corrupted plant-life. Even the [gnolls](gnolls) of eastern [Tal'Dorei](taldorei), like the [Moonsteeth](moonsteeth-gnolls) and [Priest-Eaters](priest-eater-gnolls) stick to the southern edge of the forest.

The southern edge of the forest marks the southern boundary between the [Alabaster Sierras](alabaster-sierras) in the north and the [Dividing Plains](dividing-plains) and [Lucidian Coast](lucidian-coast) to the south.

### Salted Bluffs
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Alabaster^ ^Sierras^](alabaster-sierras) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Coastal^ ^&^ ^Mountain^

The Salted Bluffs are tall, seaside cliffs that run along the northern tip of the [Alabaster Peninsula](alabaster-sierras) where the [Alabaster Sierras](alabaster-sierra-range) meet the Frigid Depths. The cliffs are littered with caves and hidden coves and often used by pirates and smugglers. 

The cliffs are also home to a number of dangerous beasts and creatures including the [Ashwing Harpies](ashwing-harpies) and [wyverns](/monster/wyvern).

### Shearing Channel
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Alabaster^ ^Sierras^](alabaster-sierras) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Coastal^ ^&^ ^Underwater^

The Shearing Channel is a narrow passage between the continents of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei) in the west and [Wildemount](wildemount) in the east. It connects the remote ports on the [Frigid Depths](frigid-depths) from the [Lucidian Ocean](lucidian-ocean) and the rest of [Exandria's](exandria) lucrative ports.

Passage through the Shearing Channel is extremely dangerous. Extreme weather and rough seas are the norm, rather than the exception. The channel and nearby [Parchwood Bay](parchwood-bay) are full of shipwrecks and the monsters that feed on them.

### Upper Mooren River Run
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Alabaster^ ^Sierras^](alabaster-sierras) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Forest^

The Upper Mooren River Run begins its nearly 600 mile journey high in the [Alabaster Sierras](alabaster-sierra-range) and ends in the town of [Drynna](drynna) on the northwestern shore of [Mooren Lake](mooren-lake), passing the city of [Whitestone](whitestone) along the way.

As the river makes it's way south, it gains strength from countless streams and smaller rivers that flow down from the Alabasters along the way. It roars through the [Parchwood Timberland](parchwood-timberland) and then widens and slows through the eastern [Dividing Plains](dividing-plains).

The Upper Mooren River Run is barely navigable. There are numerous falls and intense rapids at various points along the river. It is most certainly a one-way trip with travel up-river impossible by non-magical means.
