### Blazing Foundry
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Dividing^ ^Plains^](dividing-plains) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Forest^ ^&^ ^Elemental^

Located on the western edge of the [Ivyheart Thicket](ivyheart-thicket), the Blazing Foundry is all that remains of an ancient [Founding Age](founding) settlement. While some of the ruins were left intact, much of the village was destroyed by [Thordak](thordak) on his way to [Emon](emon) during the reign of the [Chroma Conclave](chroma-conclave).

Very little is known about these ruins, but archaeologists from the [Alabaster Lyceum](alabaster-lyceum) are investigating the ruins.

### Bramblewood
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Dividing^ ^Plains^](dividing-plains) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Forest^

The Bramblewood is a large forest that stretches along most of the eastern slope of the [Cliffkeep Mountain's](cliffkeep-mountain-range) [Gatshadow](gatshadow) spur. It begins in the [Black Valley](black-valley) to the north, skirts the western edge of [Westruun](westruun) and around the southern face of the massive [Gatshadow](gatshadow).

Aptly named, the Bramblewood is a tangled mess of oak-like trees with long, razor-sharp thorns protruding from the tree's bark. The combination of a thick undergrowth, tangled roots, and dagger-like thorns makes a simple stroll in the forest a dangerous affair. Add in the various monstrosities and beasts that call the Bramblewood home and it is easy to understand why the locals stick to the edges.

### Byhills River
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Dividing^ ^Plains^](dividing-plains) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Mountain^ ^&^ ^Grassland^

The Byhills River is a long river that begins high in the southern range of [Cliffkeep Mountains](cliffkeep-mountain-range) and winds southward through the [Dividing Plains](dividing-plains), across the [Silvercut Roadway](silvercut-roadway) to the [Foramere Basin](foramere-basin) at the base of the [Stormcrest Mountains](stormcrest-mountains).

Formed by a number of smaller streams beginning in the southern [Cliffkeeps](cliffkeep-mountain-range), most of the Byhills' force comes from two major tributaries. The [Wildwood](wildwood-forest) branch begins in the [Wildwood](wildwood-forest) east of [Kraghammer](kraghammer), while the [Torian](torian-forest) branch begins southwest of the city in the eastern [Torian Forest](torian-forest).

The upper branches of the river are small, rocky, and forceful. The river widens and calms some as it enters the plains, but is still swift. It is roughly 360 miles from either of it's sources to the [Foramere Basin](foramere-basin).

> The upper branches of the river are not named on any previous maps, but local [Toppers](toppers) refer to them by the forest from which they originate. It seemed like a logical conclusion, so I've added them to my maps and this encyclopedia.

### Dawnmist Pines
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Dividing^ ^Plains^](dividing-plains) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Forest^

Dawnmist Pines is a small evergreen forest located in eastern [Tal'Dorei](taldorei), northwest of the town of [Turst Fields](turst-fields). It sits at the southern end of the [Dawnmist Bay](dawnmist-bay) and is often blanketed in fog that drifts down from the [East Range](cliffkeep-mountain-range) of the [Cliffkeep Mountains](cliffkeep-mountain-range).

### Foramere

### Foramere Basin
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Dividing^ ^Plains^](dividing-plains) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Coastal^ ^&^ ^Grassland^

Foramere Basin is a large, crystal clear lake located in the heart of the [Dividing Plains](dividing-plains). The lake was once the ice fortress of [Errevon the Rimelord](errevon) during the [Icelost Years](history). When [Errevon](errevon) was defeated and bansihed to his home plane, the fortress melted and became the lake.

The lake is replenished by snowmelt from the [Cliffkeep Mountains](cliffkeep-mountain-range) by the [Byhills River](byhills-river) and the [Stormcrest Mountains](stormcrest-mountains) by the [Tundrun River](tundrun-river). The [Foramere Waterway](foramere-waterway) leaves the eastern side of the lake and empties into the [Lucidian Ocean](lucidian-ocean) in the [Owlset Bay](owlset-bay).

The Foramere is an important source of fresh fish to central [Tal'Dorei](taldorei) and a number of small fishing villages dot the western shore. The largest is the village of [Foramere](foramere).

[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Dividing^ ^Plains^](dividing-plains) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Grassland^ ^&^ ^Coastal^

The Foramere Waterway is a large, but short river that exits the east side of the [Foramere Basin](foramere-basin) and heads east to the [Owlset Bay](owlset-bay) and the [Lucidian Ocean](lucidian-ocean). The river is a little under 200 miles from the [Basin](foramere-basin) to the [Bay](owlset-bay).

### Ironseat Ridge
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Dividing^ ^Plains^](dividing-plains) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Hill^ ^&^ ^Mountain^

Ironseat Ridge is a small ridge that lies on the western edge of the [Dividing Plains](dividing-plains) of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei). The ridge, looks vaguely like a chair and is a prominent landmark to travelers on both the cross-continental [Silvercut Roadway](silvercut-roadway) and north-south [Wildwood Byway](wildwood-byway). 

Once home to a number of prosperous mines, the Ironseat has been largely pilfered of it's riches. Creatures of various types now prowl the abandoned mine shafts that criss-cross through it's interior.

The residents of [Kymal](kymal) can often hear the wind howling through the old tunnels and what was once a symbol of the city's prosperity is now a constant reminder of days gone by.

### Ivyheart Thicket
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Dividing^ ^Plains^](dividing-plains) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Forest^

The Ivyheart Thicket is a dense, mess of trees and underbrush located on the western edge of the [Dividing Plains](dividing-plains). The forest lies west of the north-south running [Wildwood Byway](wildwood-byway) and surrounds much of the ruined village of [Torthil](ruins-of-torthil).

After the destruction of [Torthil](ruins-of-torthil), the forest quickly grew wilder and more dangerous. Without frequent hunters and loggers maintaining trails and camps, the undergrowth began to take hold and the forest quickly became a tangled mess.

On the western edge of the forest, ruins of an ancient, pre-[Calamity](history) civilization was recently discovered by arcane-archaeologists from the [Alabaster Lyceum](alabaster-lyceum). Little is known about the people that once lived there and it is unlikely anyone will ever uncover it's secrets. During the time of the [Chroma Conclave](chroma-conclave), [Thordak](thordak-the-cinder-king) attacked the ruin and left a fiery ruin now called the [Blazing Foundry](blazing-foundry).

### Parchwood Way
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Dividing^ ^Plains^](dividing-plains) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Grassland^

The Parchwood Way is a well-traveled road that connects the settlements of [Drynna](drynna) and [Turst Fields](turst-fields) with the rest of the [Tal'Dorei Republic](council-of-taldorei). It heads northeast from the city of [Westruun](westruun) and passes south of the [Black Valley](black-valley), [Dawnmist Pines](dawnmist-pines), and [Parchwood Timberland](parchwood-timberland) linking the three settlements together.

While no road is completely safe, the Parchwood Way is heavily patrolled by the [Shields of the Plains](shields-of-the-plains) between the city of [Westruun](westruun) and [Turst Fields](turst-fields). The stretch to [Drynna](drynna) is not as heavily patrolled and raids by gnoll tribes out of the [Rootgarden Marsh](rootgarden-marsh) and southern [Parchwood Timberland](parchwood-timberland) are not uncommon.

### Ruins of Torthil
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Dividing^ ^Plains^](dividing-plains) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Forest^

The village of Torthil was a small village located south of [Kymal](kymal) on the [Wildwood Byway](wildwood-byway). It was an insignificant stop on the road to [Syngorn](syngorn) that now serves as a stark reminder of a brutal war waged long ago.

All that remains of Torthil are broken stone buildings and an obsidian monument to the death of [Warren Drassig](drassig-warren). The village was the sight of a well-executed ambush of Drassig's forces during the [Scattered War](history) and a subsequent massacre at the hands of Warren's son, [Neminar](drassig-neminar).

### Shadebarrow
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Dividing^ ^Plains^](dividing-plains) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Grassland^

The Shadebarrow is an ancient ritual site of a tribe of druids known as the [Dawn Circle](dawn-circle). Exterminated by the [Drassigs](house-of-drassig) in the lead up to the [Scattered War](scattered-war, the land would eventually be acquired by a wealthy noble, [Baron Sevil Howthess](howthess-sevil), from [Westruun](westruun). Obsessed with the barrow, [Howthess](howthess-sevil) is rumored to be entombed there with many of his personal treasures and wealth.

### Silvercut Crossroads
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Dividing^ ^Plains^](dividing-plains) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Grassland^

The Silvercut Crossroads is the intersection of the east-west transcontinental [Silvercut Roadway](silvercut-roadway) and the north-south [Wildwood Byway](wildwood-byway). While the crossroads is an important milestone on both roads, travelers take care to never rest for the night nearby. 

In the years leading up to and during the [Scattered War](history), the crossroads were used to hold mass executions. Mass graves are scattered throughout the area, holding the remains of disidents and critics of the [Drassigs](house-of-drassig).

### Silvercut Roadway
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Dividing^ ^Plains^](dividing-plains) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Grassland^

The Silvercut Roadway is a cross-continental road that serves as the central artery of the nascent [Republic of Tal'Dorei](council-of-taldorei). The road stretches nearly 1,000 miles from the capital of [Emon](emon) to the eastern port city of [Stilben](stilben) on the [Lucidian Ocean](lucidian-ocean).

The road is vital to the [Republic](council-of-taldorei) and heavily patrolled by the [Arms of Emon](arms-of-emon), [Shields of the Plains](shields-of-the-plains), and the [Waterwatch](waterwatch) near the cities of [Emon](emon), [Westruun](westruun), and [Stilben](stilben) respectively.

### Throne of the Arch Heart
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Dividing^ ^Plains^](dividing-plains) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Grassland^

The Throne of the Arch Heart is a small rise located on the southwestern side of the [Ironseat Ridge](ironseat-ridge). The rise is a sacred gathering place for the [centaurs](centaurs) of the [Dividing Plains](dividing-plains) and home to the [Herdsmeet](centaurs), a meeting of the various tribes that occurs every ten years.

According to both [centaur](centaurs) and [orc](orcs) legends, the Throne of the Arch Heart is the birthplace of both races. It marks the final battle between [Corellon](corellon) and [Gruumsh](gruumsh) during the [Calamity](history) and the [Herdsmeet](centaurs) is a source of tension, and often violence between the two races.

### Torian Forest
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Dividing^ ^Plains^](dividing-plains) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Forest^

The Torian Forest is a large wood that stands on the southern slope of the [Cliffkeep Mountain's southern range](cliffkeep-mountain-range). The forest is a chief source of timber for the cities of [Emon](emon) and [Kraghammer](kraghammer) and the forest is widely considered to be one of the safer forests in [Exandria](geography).

Despite it's reputation, the Torian is still a wild and unforgiving place. It is not uncommon for dangerous creatures to come down from the mountains and there are pockets of displaced fey creatures in some of the darker corners of the forest.

The northern end of the forest transitions to damp fens and is home to the [Rivermaw Tribe](rivermaw-tribe), a nomadic tribe of disparate people who have shunned life in the more populous areas of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei).

[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Dividing^ ^Plains^](dividing-plains) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Mountain^ ^&^ ^Grassland^

The Tundrun River is a small, but mighty river that descends rapidly from the north slope of the [Stormcrest Mountains](stormcrest-mountains), along the western edge of the [Frostweald](frostweald) and into the [Foramere Basin](foramere-basin) in the [Dividing Plains](dividing-plains). The river is very fast and rocky and is not navigable.

**^Type:^** ^Grassland,^ ^Hill^ ^&^ ^Forest^

The Wildwood Byway is the main north-south road that leads from the [dwarven](dwarves) city of [Kraghammer](kraghammer) in the [Cliffkeep Mountains](cliffkeep-mountain-range) to the [elven](elven) city of [Syngorn](syngorn) in the [Verdant Expanse](verdant-expanse). Despite this seemingly direct connection between the two cities, virtually no traffic travels the entirety of the byway.

Following the [Scattered War](history), earned the nickname, the "Traitor's Stair" due to [Kraghammer's](kraghammer) alliance with the tyrannical [Drassig](drassig-warren) against the [elves](elves) and the [Tal'Dorei](taldorei-zan) alliance.
