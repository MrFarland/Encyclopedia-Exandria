### Ashen Gorge
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Stormcrest^ ^Mountains^](stormcrest-mountains)

**^Type:^** ^Mountain^ ^&^ ^Elemental^

The Ashen Gorge is a volcano located on the eastern end of the [Stormcrest Mountains](stormcrest-mountains). The mountain appears to have two distinct peaks with a large gorge between them, but the gorge, is in fact, the volcano's caldera and the twin peaks all that remains of the mountain's original peak. 

The Ashen Gorge is also known as the "Dragon's Throne" as it was the home of the [ancient red dragon](/monster/ancient-red-dragon), [Thordak the Cinder King](thordak-the-cinder-king) for many years.

The gorge is a harsh environment full of ash, streams of magma, noxious gases and smoke. As inhospitable as the gorge would appear, it is home to three competing tribes. The [Scions of Flame](scions-of-flame), the [Tinysoot](tinysoot-tribe), and the [Black Snow](black-snow-tribe). All three fight for control of the gorge and the vast riches of [Thordak's](thordak-the-cinder-king) horde.

Rumors speak of multiple hordes stashed throughout the vast network of tunnels that twist and wind through the heart of the mountain. Among them are the [Obsidian Geode](obsidian-geode) and the [Everflame Crevasse](everflame-crevasse), two of the richest and those the tribes fight over constantly.

### Dreamseep Marshlands
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Stormcrest^ ^Mountains^](stormcrest-mountains)

**^Type:^** ^Swamp^

The Dreamseep Marshlands is an expansive swamp that covers most of the northern [Kirmont Valley](kirmont-valley). Fed by countless tiny rivers, the [Dreamseep River](dreamseep-river) provides the marshland with a constant supply of murky, brown water.

Located in a remote corner of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei), the Dreamseep Marshland does not receive many visitors. The tiny village of [Bronbog](bronbog) is the only permanent settlement in the swamp, but there are numerous [Lizardfolk](lizardfolk), [Bullywug](/monster/bullywug), and [Grung](grung) camps and villages scattered throughout. While there are few [orc](orcs) tribes in the valley, the ancient [Shrine of the Ruiner](shrine-of-the-ruiner) draws [orc](orcs) pilgrims from the [Frostweald](frostweald) and beyond.

The Dreamseep is plagued by undeath. Locals believe the marshland is cursed and many that die within the swamp are reborn as foul undead creatures. Legends tell of an ancient necropolis known as the [Tomb of Udah](tomb-of-udah). While other rumors tell of secret entrances to the [Underdark](underdark) and ways to the [Drow](elves) city of [Ruhn-Shak](ruhn-shak) deep beneath the [Stormpoint Mountains](stormpoint-mountains).

The only thing that brings visitors to the Dreamseep is the rare fungus known as "Queenscap". Used to create [Potions of Superior Healing](/item/potion-of-superior-healing), the Queenscap is nearly extinct in other swamps of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei).

### Dreamseep River
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Stormcrest^ ^Mountains^](stormcrest-mountains)

**^Type:^** ^Swamp^

The Dreamseep river is a slow moving river that begins in countless creeks and streams high in the [Stormcrest](stormcrest-mountains) and [Stormpoint](stormpoint-mountains) mountains to the north and west and runs a little under 200 miles to the [Kirmont Bay](kirmont-bay) in the south.

While the Dreamseep is wide, deep, and slow enough for small boats to make their way upriver to the village of [Bronbog](bronbog), the course of the river is difficult to follow through the maze that is the [Dreamseep Marshlands](dreamseep-marshlands). It is not uncommon for boats to become lost and stuck in vegetation choked channels that criss-cross the swamp.

Cursed during the invasion of [Errevon the Rime Lord](errevon) during the [Icelost Years](icelost-years), is covered in snow and ice year round.

A very dangerous forest, the Frostweald's frigid weather is only one of the forest's many dangers. [Basilisks](/monster/basilisk) are common in the Frostweald and it is also home to the dangerous [Shivergut Tribe](shivergut-tribe). The Frostweald is also known for it's many gateways to the [Feywild](feywild) and fey creatures like [pixies](/monster/pixie), [dryads](/monster/dryad), and [nymphs](/monster/nymph) call the Frostweald home.

**^Type:^** ^Coastal^ ^&^ ^Underwater^

Kirmont Bay is a large bay on the [Lucidian](lucidian-ocean) coast of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei). It cuts inward from the ocean directly below the [Stormcrest Mountains](stormcrest-mountains) and [Dreamseep Marshlands](dreamseep-marshlands) and above the [Rifenmist Jungle](rifenmist-jungle).

Located due west of the pirate enlcave of [Darktow](darktow), the Kirmont Bay is a popular place to launch raids against the shipping lanes that run down the east coast of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei) and west to [Marquet](marquet).

### Kirmont Valley
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Stormcrest^ ^Mountains^](stormcrest-mountains)

**^Type:^** ^Grassland^ ^&^ ^Swamp^

The Kirmont Valley is a large valley located on the [Lucidian](lucidian-ocean) coast of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei). The valley is wedged between the [Stormcrest Mountains](stormcrest-mountains) to the north and the [Stormpoint Mountains](stormpoint-mountains) to the west. The valley collects a lot of run-off from these two ranges and much of the valley is covered by the [Dreamseep Marshlands](dreamseep-marshlands).

While the [Dreamseep](dreamseep-marshlands) dominates much of the valley, it isn't all swamp. The western and southern edges of the Kirmont are at a higher elevation and significantly drier. A number of smaller rivers descend through the grasslands of the southern Kirmont and empty into the [Kirmont Bay](kirmont-bay) 

Very few people call the Kirmont Valley home. The village of [Bronbog](bronbog) is the only permanent settlement in the valley, but numerous tribes call the valley home. A start contrast of what was once a heavily settled region during the [Age of Arcanum](history). Many ruins litter the valley including the tower of [Wrettis](wrettis) in the foothills of the [Stormpoints](stormpoint-mountains) and the lost [Tomb of Udah](tomb-of-udah) in the heart of the marshlands.
