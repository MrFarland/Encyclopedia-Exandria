### Feshun Narrows
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Verdant^ ^Expanse^](verdant-expanse) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Coastal,^ ^Underwater^ ^&^ ^Forest^

The Feshun Narrows is small, narrow inlet off the [Ozmit Sea](ozmit-sea) that opens into a wide, sheltered bay where the [Feshun River](feshun-river) leaves the [Verdant Expanse](verdant-expanse). The water is a mixture of fresh and saltwater and the placid waters of the bay make the narrows a safe harbor from the many tropical storms that plaque the southeastern coast of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei).

While the narrows are a good place to ride out a storm, local clans of [Sahuagin](/monster/sahuagin) claim the narrows as their home and do not tolerate trespassers.

### Feshun River
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Verdant^ ^Expanse^](verdant-expanse) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Forest^

The Feshun River begins it's journey to the [Ozmit Sea](ozmit-sea) high in the northwestern [Stormcrest Mountains](stormcrest-mountains). There it begins a 550 mile journey that descends from the mountains, through the city of [Syngorn](syngorn), plummets over the [Tormor Falls](tormor-falls), and winds through the [Verdant Expanse](verdant-expanse).

After the [falls](tormor-falls), the Feshun is joined by the [Vues'dal River](vuesdal-river) for the remainer of it's course through the [Expanse](verdant-expanse). The river is navigable by small boats through the forest, but is not a major trade route for the [elves](elves) of [Syngorn](syngorn).

> According to existing maps, the Vues'dal Waters is fed by the Feshun River, but this would mean the river flows in two directions at once.

> Having traveled these waters myself, I can attest to the direction of the Feshun and that the [Vues'dal River](vuesdal-river) flows from the [Vues'dal Waters](vuesdal-waters) to the Feshun and not the other way around.

### Gladepools
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Verdant^ ^Expanse^](verdant-expanse) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Forest^ ^&^ ^Coastal^

The Gladepools are a collection of ponds and lakes that make up the southern border of the [Verdant Expanse](verdant-expanse) and stretch from the [Ozmit Sea](ozmit-sea) to the [Stormpoint Mountains](stormpoint-mountains). The pools are in important source of fish for the people of [Byroden](byroden) in the neighboring [Mornset Countryside](mornset-countryside). Likewise, the clay found on the banks is highly desired by potters and sculptors in [Syngorn](syngorn).

It is rumored that an oracle's spirit lives in the lakes of the Gladepools and will share information on one's future in exchange for an offering.

### Mirescar
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Verdant^ ^Expanse^](verdant-expanse) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Forest^

The Mirescar is a dark corner of the [Verdant Expanse](verdant-expanse). Located on the western side of the forest, the Mirescar is one of the few places in the [Expanse](verdant-expanse) even the [elves](elves) of [Syngorn](syngorn) are reluctant to go. The entire area is corrupted by some unknown power and dire beasts, corrupted plant-life, and fey abominations call the Mirescar home.

### Orencleft
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Verdant^ ^Expanse^](verdant-expanse) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Mountain^

Orencleft is a rocky mountain located to the south of the city of [Syngorn](syngorn) on the western end of the [Stormcrest Mountains](stormcrest-mountains). On the eastern side of the mountain, the [Feshun River](feshun-river) cascades down a series of falls known collectively as the [Tormor Falls](tormor-falls). 

Behind the falls, a number of caves dive deep into the [Stormcrests](stormcrest-mountains) and some say the entrances shift and move each day. The outside is patrolled by the [Verdant Guard](verdant-guard) and it is not uncommon for creatures to wander out from time to time.

### Tormor Falls

**^Type:^** ^Mountain^ ^&^ ^Underdark^

Tormor Falls is a series of waterfalls where the [Feshun River](feshun-river) cascade down the eastern face of the [Orencleft Mountain](orencleft) on the west edge of the [Stormcrest Mountains](stormcrest-mountains). Numerous caves hide behind the various falls and lead deep into the [Orencleft](orencleft) and [Stormcrests](stormcrest-mountains). Stories tell of the caves shifting and changing each day.

Not far from the city of [Syngorn](syngorn), the base of the falls are patrolled by the [Verdant Guard](verdant-guard). While the surrounding area is relatively safe, plenty of explorers have entered the caves beneath the falls and were never heard from again.

### Vues'dal

### Vues'dal River
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Verdant^ ^Expanse^](verdant-expanse) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Forest^

The Vues'dal River begins on the western slope of the [Stormpoint Mountains](stormpoint-mountains) and flows northwest for 80 miles before it empties into the [Vues'dal Waters](vuesdal-waters). It continues out the northern side of the lake before joining the [Feshun River](feshun-river) about a 100 miles south of [Syngorn](syngorn).

The portion of the river that connects the [Vues'dal Waters](vuesdal-waters) to the [Feshun River](feshun-river) is navigable and is used to ship food upriver, as far as the [Tormor Falls](tormor-falls) to [Syngorn](syngorn).

*^Canon^ ^Consistency:^ **^Medium^**

> According to the Tal'Dorei Campaign Guide the [Feshun River](feshun-river) flows into the [Vues'dal Waters](vuesdal-waters), but this would mean the river flows north and south at the same time. Having visited the lake myself, the [Feshun River](feshun-river) does not enter the lake. The small [Vues'dal River](vuesdal-river) flows out of the lake and meets the [Feshun](feshun-river) to the north.

### Vues'dal Waters
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Verdant^ ^Expanse^](verdant-expanse) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Coastal^ ^&^ ^Forest^

Vues'dal Waters is a lake located in the southeastern corner of the [Verdant Expanse](verdant-expanse), tucked into a crook between the [Stormcrest Mountains](stormcrest-mountains) and [Stormpoint Mountains](stormpoint-mountains).

The lake was formed when the Vues'dal volcano erupted during the [Age of Arcanum](age-of-arcanum). The volcano collapsed in on itself, leaving behind a massive crater. Over time, water from the [Vues'dal River](vuesdal-river) flowed into the crater and created the Vues'dal Waters.

The land surrounding the lake is extremely fertile and farming villages have sprung up around it's banks. The largest is the town of [Vues'dal](vuesdal) on the eastern shore of the lake with roughly 1,000 people. In addition to the [elven](elves) settlements, a large [lizardfolk](lizardfolk) tribe lives in the nearby marshes and conflict between the two is not uncommon.
