### Bladeshimmer Bay
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Bladeshimmer^ ^Shoreline^](bladeshimmer-shoreline) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Coastal^ ^&^ ^Underwater^

The Bladeshimmer Bay is a large, open bay on the west coast of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei). It stretches from the [Seashale Mountains](seashale-mountains) in the north, down the [Bladeshimmer Shoreline](bladeshimmer-shoreline) and ends at a point due west of [Daggerbay](daggerbay).

The Bladeshimmer Bay is not sheltered from the open [Ozmit Sea](ozmit-sea), but the waters are relatively calm and the weather temperate. It is heavily travelled by merchant ships and fishers operating out of the Port of [Emon](emon).

While the bay is well-patroled and relatively safe, [sahuagin](/monster/sahuagin) clans and pirates operating out of the [Ruins of O'Noa](ruins-of-onoa) occassionally trouble merchants bound for [Marquet](marquet) or [Wildemount](wildemount).

### Crystalfen Caverns
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Bladeshimmer^ ^Shoreline^](bladeshimmer-shoreline) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Underdark^

Crystalfen Caverns is a massive network of underground tunnels, caverns, and rivers that date back to [Exandria's](exandria) founding. Home to an ancient aboleth civilization, the Crystalfen Caverns are extremely perilous. The Crystalfen Caverns are home to the ancient aboleth city of [Salar](ruins-of-salar), a city nearly destroyed during the Calamity, but slowly being rebuilt.

Throughout the caverns are veins of blue crystal called azuremite. This blue crystal can be ground and refined into a powder with powerful arcane properties called [Suude](/item/suude).

### Daggerbay
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Bladeshimmer^ ^Shoreline^](bladeshimmer-shoreline) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Coastal^ ^&^ ^Underwater^

Daggerbay is a small bay on the southern end of the [Bladeshimmer Shoreline](bladeshimmer-shoreline). The bay is sheltered from the rough waters of the southern [Ozmit Sea](ozmit-sea), but the entrance is well guarded by the jagged and dangerous [Slumber Reef](slumber-reef). 

The bay was once home to the colony of [O'noa](ruins-of-onoa), the first permanent, [human](humans) settlement on [Tal'Dorei](taldorei) following the Calamity. After O'Noa was destroyed during the [Scattered War](history), both the city and the bay were abandoned in favor of the already more prosperous [Emon](emon).

Over time, the bay became a haven for pirates and [sahuagin](/monster/sahuagin) with the occassional foolhardy treasure hunter looking to salvage treasure from the countless wrecks on the [Slumber Reef](slumber-reef).

### Daggerbay Mountains
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Bladeshimmer^ ^Shoreline^](bladeshimmer-shoreline) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Mountain^ ^&^ ^Hill^

The Daggerbay Mountains are jagged, rocky peaks located on the southern end of the [Bladeshimmer Shoreline](bladeshimmer-shoreline). Due east of [Daggerbay](daggerbay), the mountains serve as a border between the [elven](elves) nation of [Syngorn](syngorn) and the [human](humans) [Republic of Tal'Dorei](council-of-taldorei). 

Located on the northern end of range, the [Emerald Outpost](emerald-outpost) keeps watch over the [Emerald Path](emerald-path) and protects the valuable trade caravans that pass between the two nations. 

Clans of [stone](/monster/stone-giant) and [hill](/monster/hill-giant) giants regularly harass travelers and raid supply wagons, as do [bandits](/monster/bandits) operating out of the [ruins of O'Noa](ruins-of-onoa).

### Emerald Path
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Bladeshimmer^ ^Shoreline^](bladeshimmer-shoreline) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Coastal^ ^&^ ^Grassland^

The Emerald Path is the main road that leads from the [human](humans) city of [Emon](emon) to the [elven](elves) city of [Syngorn](syngorn). It winds its way down the [Bladeshimmer Shoreline](bladeshimmer-shoreline) passing close to the [Ruins of O'Noa](onoa) before turning east toward the [Daggerbay Mountains](daggerbay-mountains) and the [Emerald Outpost](emerald-outpost). It continues through the mountains and joins the [Wildwood Byway](wildwood-byway) on it's way south to [Syngorn](syngorn).

The Emerald Path is well patrolled by both the [Arms of Emon](arms-of-emon) and the [Verdant Guard](verdant-guard). The stretches nearest [Emon](emon), [Emerald Outpost](emerald-outpost) and [Syngorn](syngorn) being the safest. The stretch through the [Daggerbay Mountains](daggerbay-mountains) is heavily patrolled, but is still quite dangerous. Likewise, the stretch nearest the ruined city of [O'noa](ruins-of-onoa) is plagued by bandits operating out of the ancient ruined city.

### Emerald River
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Bladeshimmer^ ^Shoreline^](bladeshimmer-shoreline) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Grassland^

The Emerald River is a shallow, rocky river that descends from the [Daggerbay Mountains](daggerbay-mountains) south of the [Emerald Outpost](emerald-outpost) and out onto the plains of the [Bladeshimmer Shoreline](bladeshimmer-shoreline). It travels west nearly 150 miles where it joins the [Ivyheart Run](ivyheart-run) before emptying into the [Ozmit Sea](ozmit-sea).

The Emerald River is navigable via small boats for much of its lower course. It starts as a rushing torrent of water in the [Daggerbay Mountains](daggerbay-mountains), but quickly widens and shallows as it hits the plains. 

The [Emerald Path](emerald-path) follows the river for most of its course before diverging at the base of the mountains and heading due east to the [Emerald Outpost](emerald-outpost).

*^Canon^ ^Consistency:^ **^Medium^** ^-^ ^(Tal'Dorei^ ^Campaign^ ^Guide,^ ^p.^ ^87)^*


> It is hard to believe, but there is no official name for this river in any published materials on the region or on any maps. I can only assume these materials were destroyed during the [Scattered War](history). The locals assure me it is called the "Emerald River".

### Flamereach Grove
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Bladeshimmer^ ^Shoreline^](bladeshimmer-shoreline) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Forest^ ^&^ ^Elemental^

Flamereach Grove is a small forest located about a day's walk east of the city of [Emon](emon). The forest was known as the [Shivergreen Grove](shivergreen-grove) until [Thordak the Cinder King](thordak-cinder-king) and the [Chroma Conclave](chroma-conclave) attacked in 815 PD. 

After the attack the surrounding area was turned into the "Scar of the Cinder King" and the forest continues to burn to this day. The trees in the forest are charred black and the forest floor is covered in continuously burning embers and ash.

The forest sits on the edge of the [Snowember Fields](snowember-fields) and a squat, stone fortress called the [Flamereach Outpost](flamereach-outpost) keeps watch over both.

### Ivyheart Run
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Bladeshimmer^ ^Shoreline^](bladeshimmer-shoreline) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Forest^ ^&^ ^Grassland^

Ivyheart Run is a small river that begins deep within the [Ivyheart Thicket](ivyheart-thicket) of the [Dividing Plains](dividing-plains) and heads west over the plains of the [Bladeshimmer Shoreline](bladeshimmer-shoreline) to the [Ozmit Sea](ozmit-sea).

The Ivyheart Run is not a big, deep, or fast-moving river, but it is navigable via small boat for much of its 300 mile course. Wide open grasslands and the occassional grove of trees line the banks. 

Shortly before it's arrival at the sea, the Run joins with the [Emerald River](emerald-river) north of the ruined city of [O'Noa](ruins-of-onoa).

*^Canon^ ^Consistency:^ **^Medium^***

> Like the [Emerald River](emerald-river) to the south, there is no official name for this river in any published materials on the region or on any maps. I can only assume these materials were destroyed during the [Scattered War](history). The locals assure me it is called the "Emerald River".

### Nightwash Tide
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Bladeshimmer^ ^Shoreline^](bladeshimmer-shoreline) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Coastal^ ^&^ ^Mountain^

The Nightwash Tide is a series of interconnected bays, coves and lagoons at the base of the[Seashale Mountains](seashale-mountains) on the northern end of the [Bladeshimmer Shoreline](bladeshimmer-shoreline). Many of these bays extend deep into the heart of the mountains and twist and turn into a labyrinth of brackish water.

The Nightwash is a seemingly endless supply of food for the villages of the [Shalesteps](shalesteps) and their chief export. Fish and other marine life is washed in with the tide from the [Ozmit Sea](ozmit-sea) and trapped in the lagoon. Fishers from the nearby village of [Puddlefoot](shalesteps) rarely have to venture out into the open-water to fill their nets for the day.

Fishing the Nightwash is not without risks. The same tide that brings in fish, occassionally brings in creatures a little too dangerous for the fishers to deal with on their own.

### Othendin Trail
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Bladeshimmer^ ^Shoreline^](bladeshimmer-shoreline) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Grassland^ ^&^ ^Mountain^

The Othendin Trail is a long road that winds its way north from the bustling city of [Emon](emon), past the [Shalestep Mountains](shalestep-mountains) and on to the [Othendin Pass](othendin-pass). For the soldiers stationed at [Fort Daxio](fort-daxio), it is their only connection to [Emon](emon) and the [Council of Tal'Dorei](council-of-taldorei).

The trail is heavily patrolled by the [Arms of Emon](arms-of-emon) near the city and by the [army](army-of-taldorei) in the pass, but is relatively unguarded for much of its length. Fortunately, the regularity of military traffic and supply caravans does provide some degree of protection to travelers.

### Ruins of Salar
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Bladeshimmer^ ^Shoreline^](bladeshimmer-shoreline) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Underdark^

The city of Salar was once a great [aboleth](/monster/aboleth) city located deep within the [Crystalfen Caverns](crystalfen-caverns) beneath the [Bladeshimmer Shoreline](bladeshimmer-shoreline). The city thrived during the Age of Arcanum but was nearly destroyed during the Calamity. The city is a shadow of its former self, but it is rebuilding.

The architecture of Salar is completely alien to the [races](races) of Exandria. Those who know of its existence call it the "Unseeable City" because those who look upon it are known to have descended into madness. The city is illuminated by a massive pearlescent disc, called the Moon Disc.

### Ruins of Vos'Sykriss
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Bladeshimmer^ ^Shoreline^](bladeshimmer-shoreline) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Jungle^

Vos'Sykriss was a large city located on the larger of the two islands known as [Visa Isle](visa-isle). It was the capital city and crowning jewel of a [Yuan-Ti](yuan-ti) civilization and it dominated the coast of southwestern [Tal'Dorei](tal'dorei). 

The [Yuan-Ti](yuan-ti) civilization fell during the [Calamity](history) and much of the city of Vos'Sykriss' fell into ruin. Over time, what remained of the [Yuan-Ti](yuan-ti) simply vanished from the face of [Exandria](geography).

Undead [Yuan-Ti](yuan-ti) still patrol and defend their ancestral home, while countless others lie in a form of stasis or hibernation deep within the ancient halls of the city. 

In the early 800s, an expedition from the [Alabaster Lyceum](alabaster-lyceum) explored the ruined city and brought back many artifacts. Shortly after their departure, the [Yuan-Ti](yuan-ti) began to awaken from their slumber.

### Scar of the Cinder King
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Bladeshimmer^ ^Shoreline^](bladeshimmer-shoreline) {.screen-only} {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Forest,^ ^Grassland,^ ^&^ ^Elemental^

The Scar of the Cinder King refers to an area east of [Emon](emon) that was ravaged by [Thordak](thordak) during the [Chroma Conclave's](chroma-conclave) assault in 812 P.D. The area includes the ever-burning [Flamereach Grove](flamereach-grove), [Snowember Fields](snowember-fields), and the [Flamereach Outpost](flamereach-outpost). 

The area is heavily scarred and cursed by elemental magic. Creatures from the [Elemental Plane of Fire](elemental-plane-of-fire) roam the area and druids from the Fire [Ashari](ashari) of [Pyrah](pyrah) and scholars from the [Alabaster Lyceum](alabaster-lyceum) are working together to monitor the area and hopefully reverse the damage.

**^Type:^** ^Mountain^ ^&^ ^Coastal^

The Seashale Mountains are a small mountain range located northwest of the city of [Emon](emon) on the northern edge of the [Bladeshimmer Shoreline](bladeshimmer-shoreline). The mountains have an unnatural shape similar to that of a rolling tide and the mountains are tall, rocky, and jagged. 

On the southwestern base of the mountains is the [Nightwash Tide](nightwash-tide) and the collection of villages known as the [Shalesteps](shalesteps).

### Shivergreen Grove
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Bladeshimmer^ ^Shoreline^](bladeshimmer-shoreline) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Forest^

The Shivergreen Gove was a small forest about a day's walk east of the city of [Emon](emon). It was a relatively safe wood, surrounded by small farming villages and just off the [Silvercut Roadway](silvercut-roadway). Farming villages dotted the countryside and the grove was an important source of game and timber.

In 815 PD, the forest was destroyed by Thordak the Cinder King and transformed into the ever-burning [Flamereach Grove](flamereach-grove). The surrounding farmland transformed into the [Snowember Fields](snowember-fields).

### Slumber Reef
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Bladeshimmer^ ^Shoreline^](bladeshimmer-shoreline) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Coastal^ ^&^ ^Underwater^

Slumber Reef is a large natural reef that guards the entrance to [Daggerbay](daggerbay). The sharp rocks and hidden coral reef make entering the bay dangerous for ships, but the shelter it provides was instrumental in the success of the early settlement of [O'Noa](ruins-of-onoa). 

Safely navigating through the reef takes skill and many a captain confident in their abilities has found themselves swimming to shore among the many sharks and creatures that call the reef home.

### Snowember Fields
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Bladeshimmer^ ^Shoreline^](bladeshimmer-shoreline) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Grassland^ ^&^ ^Elemental^

Located within the area east of [Emon](emon) known as the [Scar of the Cinder King](scar-of-the-cinder-king), the Snowember Fields is a large tract of farmland ruined by the ancient red dragon [Thordak](thordak). The entire area is covered in white ash with the occassional burnt farmhouse or barn. From a distance the Snowember looks like a snowy plain. Underneath this ash, however are ever-smoldering embers.

Creatures from the [Elemental Plane of Fire](elemental-plane-of-fire) live beneath the ash and travelling through the fields runs the risk of disturbing them.

*^Canon^ ^Consistency:^ **^High^** ^-^ ^(Tal'Dorei^ ^Campaign^ ^Guide,^ ^p.^ ^96)^*

> In the Tal'Dorei Campaign Guide, the author indicates a [magmin](/monster/magmin) will spring from the ash for every 5 feet walked in the fields. This must be an exageration. A simple trek by a party of four a 1/2 mile into the fields would spawn 2,118 [magmin](/monster/magmin).
>
> In my experience, we tended to encounter them a lot less frequently. Every hour we had about a 10% chance of disturbing some elemental creatures such as: [magmin](/monster/magmin), [cinderslags](/monster/cinderslag-elementals), and even some [fire elementals](/monster/fire-elementals).*

**^Type:^** ^Jungle^ ^&^ ^Coastal^

Visa Isle is actually two seperate islands located off the coast of the [Bladeshimmer Shoreline](bladeshimmer-shoreline) and [Verdant Expanse](verdant-expanse) in the [Ozmit Sea](ozmit-sea). 

The islands are highly volcanic with active volcanos spewing ash into the sky. Everything from the base of the peaks to the black sand beaches is covered in thick, tropical jungle.

The bigger of the two islands is home to the ruins of [Vos'Sykriss](ruins-of-vossykriss). An ancient city of a long vanished [Yuan-Ti](yuan-ti) civilization.
