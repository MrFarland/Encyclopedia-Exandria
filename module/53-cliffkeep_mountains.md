### Black Valley
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Cliffkeep^ ^Mountains^](cliffkeep-mountains)

**^Type:^** ^Hill^ ^&^ ^Mountain^

The Black Valley is located between the [Gatshadow Spur](cliffkeep-mountain-range) of the [Cliffkeep Mountains](cliffkeep-mountain-range) and the lower end of the [Eastern Range](cliffkeep-mountain-range) that runs along the western shore of the [Dawnmist Bay](dawnmist-bay).

The valley begins at the the north end of the [Bramblewood](bramblewood) and extends up to the [Umbra Hills](umbra-hills) at the base of the [Cliffkeeps](cliffkeep-mountain-range). 

Prior to the [Scattered War](history), the hills at the northern end of the valley were known as the Emerald Highlands. After the Battle of the [Umbra Hills](umbra-hills) the hills were corrupted and the name changed.

### Black Valley Path
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Cliffkeep^ ^Mountains^](cliffkeep-mountains)

**^Type:^** ^Hill^ ^&^ ^Mountain^

The Black Valley Path connects the settlement of [Jorenn Village](jorenn-village) on the edge of the [Umbra Hills](umbra-hills) to the rest of [Tal'Dorei](tal'dorei). It descends from the [Umbra Hills](umbra-hills) through the [Black Valley](black-valley) before joining the [Parchwood Way](parchwood-way) to head east to [Turst Fields](turst-fields) or southwest to [Westruun](westruun).

The Black Valley Path is not patrolled by any guard. The [Shadewatch](shadewatch) stop at the outskirts of [Jorenn Village](jorenn-village) and the [Shields of the Plains](shields-of-the-plains) rarely leave the [Parchwood Way](parchwood-way).

### Cliffkeep Mountain Range
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Cliffkeep^ ^Mountains^](cliffkeep-mountains)

**^Type:^** ^Mountain^

The Cliffkeep Mountains is a massive mountain range that covers nearly one-third of the entire continent of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei). The entire range stretches from the [Dividing Plains](dividing-plains) in the center of the continent, all the way to the ice-cold [Frigid Depths](frigid-depths) far to the north. 

Due to its massive size, the Cliffkeeps are often subdivided into five distinct ranges.

##### Eastern Range
The eastern range of the Cliffkeeps runs along the western shore of the [Dawnmist Bay](dawnmist-bay) from the [Dawnmist Pines](dawnmist-pines) in the south, along the eastern side of the [Black Valley](black-valley) to the [Neverfields](neverfields).

##### Gatshadow Spur
The Gatshadow Spur is a range that shoots down between the southern and eastern ranges towards the [Dividing Plains](dividing-plains). It frames the western side of the [Black Valley](black-valley) and comes to an abrupt halt at the massive [Gatshadow](gatshadow).

##### Northern Range
The northern range of the Cliffkeeps runs up through the center of the region, along the western edge of the [Grey Valley](grey-valley) to the [Elvenpeaks](elvenpeaks) and the city of [Lyrengorn](lyrengorn).

##### Southern Range
The southern range of the Cliffkeeps begins at the [Othendin Pass](othendin-pass) and runs along the northern border of the [Torian Forest](torian-forest) and ends east of the dwarven city of [Kraghammer](kraghammer) at the start of the Gatshadow Spur. 

##### Western Range
The western range of the Cliffkeeps is located in the nortwestern corner of the region. It includes the small chain west of the [Othendin Pass](othendin-pass), breaks north of [Fort Daxio](fort-daxio) and continues north along the northwest coast of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei).

> Due to the sheer enormity of the Cliffkeep Mountains, the various ranges are known by many names to many peoples. While these ranges are not identified on any previous maps, I decided to adopt the logical names for these ranges as given by the [dwarves](dwarves) of [Kraghammer](kraghammer) and translated into Common.

### Elvenpeaks
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Cliffkeep^ ^Mountains^](cliffkeep-mountains)

**^Type:^** ^Mountain^ ^&^ ^Arctic^

Despite it's name, the Elvenpeaks is a single mountain that has been split in the middle, by a long, slow-moving glacier. On either side of the glacier stand tall, rocky peaks. It lies at the far northern tip of the [Cliffkeep Mountains'](cliffkeep-mountain-range) northernmost range and it is the last major mountain before the endless frozen wastes of the [Neverfields](neverfields).

While the mountain and surrounding area are cold and inhospitable, a warm, temperate forest thrives beneath the ice sheet suspended between the peaks. Inside, lies the elven city of [Lyrengorn](lyrengorn), a bastion of elven culture far removed from the influence of [Syngorn](syngorn).

{.sidebar}

Emberhold is a [duergar](duergar) fortress and surrounding settlement located deep beneath the [dwarven](dwarves) settlement of [Kraghammer](kraghammer) in the underdark of the [Cliffkeep Mountains](cliffkeep-mountains). It is the cultural and political heart of the [Murghol Dynasty](murghol-dynasty).

##### Architecture
The fortress and surrounding buildings are prime examples of [duergar](duergar) architecture. They are expertly crafted from stone, but not overly decorative. Function over form.

##### Defenses
The fortress of Emberhold is a large castle crafted from obsidian. A massive magma fall cascades down on the roof of the fortress and splits to either side of the castle forming a large moat of molten rock.

Bands of [duergar](duergar) with [basilisks](/monster/basilisk) patrol the surrounding cavern and deal with intruders.

A secret entrance to the castle is rumored to exist under one of the lava flows.

##### Demographics

##### Government
Emberhold is ruled by the [Murghol Dynasty](murghol-dynasty), a monarchy currently in turmoil with an adolescent heir and various nobles vying for power.

The government is tyranical and the dynasty rules with an iron fist. Even minor dissent and disobedience is viewed as high-treason and punished severely.

##### Law & Order
Law and order in traditional [duergar](duergar) society is very different than the surface dwelling civilizations. The laws are quite different and punishments are typically harsh and cruel.

##### Religion
The [duergar](duergar) are deeply devoted to the lesser deity [Laduguer the Exile](laduguer-the-exile) and he is the only god-like being openly worshipped in Emberhold.

##### Services
It is assumed there are artisans and merchants in the stronghold of Emberhold, but nobody really knows for sure.

##### Society
Emberhold and the entirety of the [Murghol Dynasty](murghol-dynasty) civilization is extremely xenophobic and openly hostile to outsiders. They do not entertain visitors and very few who wander into the Emberhold ever leave of their own accord.

A burning hatred for the dwarves of [Kraghammer](kraghammer) is systemic. The origin for this hatred has long been forgotten, but it is maintained out of habit and reinforced by the Emberhold's leaders.

##### Trade & Industry
As a xenophobic, insular society, the [duergar](duergar) of Emberhold are largely self-sufficient. They do not actively trade with other civilizations and limit their interactions with outsiders to raids for goods and slaves.

### Emerald Highlands
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Cliffkeep^ ^Mountains^](cliffkeep-mountains)

**^Type:^** ^Hill^ ^&^ ^Mountain^

The Emerald Highlands refers to what is now known as the [Black Valley](black-valley) and [Umbra Hills](umbra-hills). The name was changed following the [Battle of the Umbra Hills](history). The name is out of use and can only be found in ancient texts.

### Gatshadow
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Cliffkeep^ ^Mountains^](cliffkeep-mountains)

**^Type:^** ^Mountain^

Gatshadow is massive mountain located at the southern end of the [Gatshadow Spur](cliffkeep-mountain-range) of the [Cliffkeep Mountains](cliffkeep-mountain-range). It towers over the [Bramblewood](bramblewood) forest and serves as prominent landmark to travelers on the [Silvercut Roadway](silvercut-roadway) and [Wildwood Byway](wildwood-byway).

Small mining operations have exploited the neighboring hills and base, but few willingly venture into the mountain's many caverns and tunnels. A massive complex of passages, chambers, traps and monsters are rumored to lay deep within the heart of the mountain and that [Tharizdun the Chained Oblivion](tharizdun-the-chained-oblivion) may be imprisoned within or kept at bay by some form of shackle or seals.

### Grey Valley
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Cliffkeep^ ^Mountains^](cliffkeep-mountains)

**^Type:^** ^Forest^ ^&^ ^Mountain^

The Grey Valley is a large valley that lies deep in the heart of the [Cliffkeep Mountains](cliffkeep-mountain-range). The valley is a dark and lifeless place, full of dead, petrified trees. 

After the Calamity, [Graz'zt the Demon Prince of Indulgence](grazzt-the-demon-prince-of-indulgence) called the valley home and it quickly began to take on his demonic influence.

During the Scattered War, [Graz'zt](grazzt-the-demon-prince-of-indulgence) was recruited to the forces of Trist Drassig and despite the Demon Prince's help, they were defeated by the combined forces of Zan Tal'Dorei and [Syngorn](syngorn) at the Battle of the [Umbra Hills](umbra-hills). In the aftermath, both the [Umbra Hills](umbra-hills) and Grey Valley were left corrupted and lifeless.

{.sidebar}

Despite the name, Jorenn Village is a small town located at the southern base of the [Umbra Hills](umbra-hills) at the northern end of the [Black Valley](black-valley). It is a remote, frontier town connected to the rest of the [Republic of Tal'Dorei](council-of-taldorei) by the [Black Valley Path](black-valley-path).

The town is not large enough for any distinguishable neighborhoods. Most locals either live "in town" or on one of the many surrounding farms, orchards, mining or logging camps.

##### Architecture
The buildings in Jorenn Village are largely made of stone quarried from the [Cliffkeep Mountains](cliffkeep-mountains) and lumber from bearby forests. The streets are dirt and often muddy, but wide to accomodate large carts hauling ore from nearby mines to the city of [Westruun](westruun) to the south.

##### Defenses
Jorenn Village has no static defenses. It is largely open and sprawls across the southern base of the [Umbra Hills](umbra-hills).

The town also lacks a regular guard force. It is too far north for the [Shields of the Plains](shields-of-the-plains) and is instead protected by an all-volunteer militia known as the [Shadewatch](shadewatch). While created out of good intentions, the [Shadewatch](shadewatch) is not much more than a gang masquerading as a town guard.

##### Demographics

##### Government
The town of Jorenn Village is governed by an elected town manager and they oversee day-to-day operation of the town. The position does not have a lot of authority and they often look to the Margrave of [Westruun](westruun) for help with larger matters.

While the town is part of the [Republic](council-of-taldorei), Jorenn Village is so far removed as to be nearly autonomous. It is a wild, frontier town that is just barely a rung above lawlessness.

##### Law & Order
Crime is a little on the high side in Jorenn Village, but not out of control. Random fights between rival miners, the occassional theft, and a myriad of other low-level crimes are common enough to keep people on their toes.

Unfortunately for the people of Jorenn Village, the town is rife with corruption. There is very little protection from the [Shadewatch](shadewatch) and people generally expect to have to fend for themselves. While, they are an all-volunteer organization, the [Shadewatch](shadewatch) has begun extorting local businesses to pay for their protection and is quickly starting to resemble a thieves' guild than a town gaurd..

##### Religion
As a small, frontier town there are no permanent temples to any of the gods, but there are small shrines to [Avandra](avandra), [Modradin](moradin), and [Pelor](pelor).

##### Services
The town of Jorenn Village is growing due to a recent boom in mining and it is slowly transitioning from small, rural village, to small boom town. Services related to the growing mining industry are the most prominent and as the number of travellers to this out-of-the-way town increase, so do services catering to those travellers.

> ***Note:** Support value is the # of people needed to support a given service. This is just a helpful guide. There are always execptions. Also, a settlement too small for a dedicated service, does not mean that service is not available.*
<!-- {blockquote: .paper} -->

##### Society
The people of Jorenn Village are rough, rugged people accustomed to life on the edge of untamed wilderness. The people are largely self-sufficient and not used to relying on others to solve their problems.

##### Trade & Industry
While the mining industry is growing, Jorenn Village's principle export is the spice known as 'Shadegrass'. This spice only grows in the [Umbra Hills](umbra-hills) and has become very popular with chefs in the larger cities of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei).

Farming and orchards are also plentiful in the valley, but most of that food stays local, with excess exported to [Westruun](westruun).

The dwarven stronghold of [Krahammer](kraghammer) is a large dwarven city in the [Cliffkeep Mountains](cliffkeep-mountains) and the center of [dwarven](dwarves) culture on the continent of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei). 

**Top Slab**. The "Arch" as it is also known is a large ring with various residential neighborhoods shooting of in different directions. The "Otherwalk" is home to most of the non-dwarven population in Kraghammer. The Top Slab is also home to the city's main markets and shopping district.
- [Balgus Brewery](balgus-brewery)
- [Firebrook Inn](firebrook-inn)
- [Ironhearth Tavern](ironhearth-tavern)
- [Starshrine](starshrine)
- [Temple of the All Hammer](temple-of-the-all-hammer)
- [Value of Valor](value-of-valor)

**Center Slab**. The Center Slab is known as the "Heart" of Kraghammer and it is both the administrative and political center of the city. The [Pyrethrone](pyrethrone) and major [houses of kraghammer](houses-of-kraghammer) are located in the center of the slab with more affluent neighborhoods on the outside edges.
- [Bronzegrip Manor](house-bronzegrip)
- [Glorenthal Manor](glorenthal-manor)
- [Greyspine Manor](house-greyspine)
- [Pyrethrone](pyrethrone)
- [Thunderbrand Manor](house-thunderbrand)
- [Zuurthom Manor](house-zuurthom)

**Bottom Slab**. The "Pit" as it is called, is the industrial center of the city. Massive quarries, mines, blast furnaces, and smithies fill the bottom level with smoke and soot.
- [Bronzegrip Metalworks](bronzegrip-metalworks)
- [Cracksackle Headquarters](cracksackle-headquarters)
- [Glowgrove](glowgrove)
- [Hall of Burning Mushrooms](hall-of-burning-mushrooms)
- [Keenstone Quarry](keenstone-quarry)

**Toppers**. Toppers are the people that live outside the city in the surrounding countryside. They are the farmers that grow food for the city and the foresters that harvest the trees of the [Wildwood](wildwood). While the individual villages and hamlets have their own names, the people are collectively referred to as toppers.

##### Architecture
Kraghammer is a showpiece of mastercraft dwarven masonry and stonecraft. There is no inch of the city that is not carefully crafted for maximum beauty and utilty. Fond of geometric shapes and patterns, the architecture is very angular and precise.

Near the center of the city, many of the buildings have a free-standing appearance, while some are built into the massive columns that hold up the massive ceilings for each level. Many of these towers serving as multi-tenant apartment buildings for lower income members of Kraghammer society.

The overall layout of the city is designed around a central core on the three distinct levels. Each level radiates outward from the core with the most essential businesses and industries near the center and residential and non-essential structures. Large elevators provide easy transit between the levels.

##### Defenses
Kraghammer is a fortress. The entrance to the city is carved into the side of Mount Kraghammer and fronted by a massive chasm. A single stone bridge spans the chasm and it is wide enough for large wagons to cross single-file. Large, fortified towers guard the bridge, while even larger towers, set into the mountain face protect the massive adamantine gates.

Defense of the city falls to the [Carvers](carvers), a highly-trained guard and military.

##### Demographics

##### Government
Kraghammer is ruled by the five noble houses of Kraghammer known as the [Houses of Kraghammer](houses-of-kraghammer). They form a council and elect one of their own to serve as the Ironkeeper, an executive position tasked with day-to-day administration of the city.

##### Law & Order
Kraghammer has very little crime. The [Carvers](carvers) are seemingly everywhere and [dwarven](dwarves) society, at least in Kraghammer, is lawful and unlikely to cause trouble outside of the occassional fight or scuffle spilling out from a pub or tavern.

Penalties for crimes are more severe in than in places like [Emon](emon) or [Syngorn](syngorn), but nearly all sentences come with a fine that can help the perpetrator avoid jail time.

##### Religion
[Moradin](moradin) is the dominant religion in Kraghammer by a wide margin, but [Bahamut](bahamut) and [Kord](kord) are also popular.

Located on the Top Slab, the [Temple of the All Hammer](temple-of-the-all-hammer) is a large and beautiful temple to [Moradin](moradin) and is considered by most [dwarves](dwarves) to be the center of their faith.

While the [dwarves](dwarves) of Kraghammer are not intolerant of other faiths, they're not exactly welcoming either. There are no other permanent temples to the other [Prime Deities](prime-deities) and most followers of other faiths worship at the [Starshrine](starshrine) on the top slab.

##### Services
Kraghammer is heavily focused on crafting and heavy industry. Master craftsmen of all kinds can be found around nearly every corner of the city. The likely has many more skilled artisans, smiths, and masons than surface cities of a comparable size.

While there is no shortage of pubs and taverns, Kraghammer does not have as many visitors as other cities of its size. Inns for travelers and adventurers would be found on the Top Slab or in the surface settlements. Some hostels or boarding houses might be found on the bottom slab to provide temporary housing for new workers. Likewise, any stables or liveries would likely be found just inside the main gate or above ground.

Canonically, Kraghammer does not have much in the way of magic shops, magical supply stores, or general enchanters. It is largely controlled by [House Thunderbrand](house-thunderbrand) as the [dwarves](dwarves) of Kraghammer are generally not big practicioners of the arcane arts.

##### Society
Kraghammer is a relatively isolated and insular society and a little xenophobic. The [dwarves](dwarves) of Kraghammer are distrustful of outsiders in general and certain races, especially. There is a lot of bad blood between the [dwarves](dwarves) of Kraghammer and the [elves](elves) of [Syngorn](syngorn) and while relations between the two have improved, long-lived races do not forgive and forget easily. 

Despite their hang-ups and biases, the [dwarves](dwarves) of Kraghammer pride themselves on being good hosts. The [Carvers](carvers) may keep a close eye on the strange visitors, but the rest are happy to share a meal and a pint with their guests.

##### Trade & Industry
While Kraghammer is socially and culturally insular, the city does an enormous amoung of trade with the [Republic of Tal'Dorei](council-of-taldorei) among others. Raw materials such as metals, gems, and stone are exported in great quantities, but it is their finished goods that are in high demand. The dwarves are known for their masterfully crafted armor, weapons, jewelry, and other goods.

The elven city of Lyrengorn is an indepedent city-state located between the [Elvenpeaks](elvenpeaks) in the northern range of the [Cliffkeep Mountain Range](cliffkeep-mountain-range) on the southern edge of the [Neverfields](neverfields).

##### Architecture
The architecture of Lyrengorn is undeniably elven in nature, but is unique and less formal than can be found in cities like [Syngorn](syngorn). 

##### Defenses
Lyrengorn is a city that does not have much in the way of structured defenses or standing military. It relies on its location, the shelter of the [Elvenpeaks](elvenpeaks) and its strident neutrality to keep it safe.

##### Demographics

##### Government
Lyrengorn manages to walk a fine line between freedom and anarchy. The city is governed by a small council, but the body is largely ceremonial. They rule with an extremely light-touch and the people of Lyrengorn are given incredible freedom to live their lives peacefully.

##### Religion
The dominant religion of Lyrengorn is [Sehanine the Moon Weaver](sehanine). While [Corellon](corellon) does have a following in the city, he is not nearly as revered as in other elven settlements.

##### Services
Lyrengorn is not a large city and does not receive a lot of visitors. The local economy is largely self-sufficient with only a fraction supporting the export/import of goods.

The city of O'Noa was the first permanent, [human](humans) settlement on the continent of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei) following the Calamity. Over time it would become an important port in a burgeoning [human](humans) empire that included much of the [Bladeshimmer Shoreline](bladeshimmer-shoreline). After the Scattered War, the city of O'Noa was destroyed and abandoned. [Emon](emon) had long supplanted it as the dominant city on the coast and O'Noa fell to ruin.

A few centuries later, people started to move into the ruins. The settlement called "New O'Noa" quickly became a haven for criminals and outcasts. They live on the fringes of civilization, outside the laws of the [Council of Tal'Dorei](council-of-taldorei). To the untrained eye, the city is still an abandoned ruin. The denizens of New O'Noa have become quite adept at remaining unseen and operating in the shadows.

While New O'Noa is relatively small and fits within roughly 1 square mile, the ruins are much larger.

##### Architecture
Much of O'Noa's original architecture has crumbled and fallen away. The current settlement looks more like a shanty town with haphazard construction using scrap materials scavenged from the ruins.

##### Defenses
There is no organized defenses for the new settlement within the ruins. The original walls and towers have collapsed and they offer no real protection. 

Instead of traditional defenses, O'Noa relies on well-hidden watchers to alert the others of intruders poking around where they don't belong.

##### Demographics

##### Government
O'Noa is ruled by whomever among them has the charisma, will, and ruthlessness to call the shots. 

##### Law & Order
The law is determined by whomever is currently in charge. Vigilante justice is common and crime rampant.

The [Clasp](clasp) has limited influence in O'Noa. The people of O'Noa are not keen on anyone telling them what to do and that includes organized thieves' guilds as well as governments.

##### Religion
Religion is not a big part of society in O'Noa. While some may offer prayers to [Avandra](avandra), [Kord](kord), or [Sehanine](sehanine-the-moon-weaver) many in O'Noa have more in common with the [Betrayers](betrayer-gods): [Asmodeus](asmodeus-the-lord-of-the-hells), [Gruumsh](gruumsh-the-ruiner), and [Tharizdun](tharizdun-the-chained-oblivion).

##### Services
There are no shops or full-time merchants in the ruins of O'noa. 

##### Society
Life in O'Noa is harsh and unforgiving. Survival of the fittest is the golden rule and the people are incredibly self-sufficient and tough.

##### Trade & Industry
O'Noa's principle trade is crime. Bandits raid trade caravans on the [Emerald Path](emerald-path), while the few pirates that call O'Noa home raid the shipping lanes between [Tal'Dorei](taldorei) and [Marquet](marquet).

### Neverfields
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Cliffkeep^ ^Mountains^](cliffkeep-mountains)

**^Type:^** ^Arctic^

The Neverfields is a massive arctic plain that lies to the north of the seemingly endless  [Cliffkeep Mountains](cliffkeep-mountains). A frozen wasteland, the Neverfields is a land of shifting ice, whirling snowstorms and biting cold. 

Despite the savage conditions, the Neverfields are not lifeless. The frozen wastes are home to many dangerous creatures and a few tribes, like the [Icewalkers](icewalkers), that venture in to the Neverfields to hunt them.

### Othendin Pass
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Cliffkeep^ ^Mountains^](cliffkeep-mountains)

**^Type:^** ^Hill^ ^&^ ^Mountain^

Othendin Pass is a large valley that divides the southern and western ranges of the [Cliffkeep Mountains](cliffkeep-mountain-range). The area is newly settled by [human](humans) from the [Bladeshimmer Shoreline](bladeshimmer-shoreline) and has come under the protection of the [Republic of Tal'Dorei](republic-of-taldorei) with the construction of [Fort Daxio](fort-daxio) after the Scattered War.

The area was once home to a number of [stone giant](/monster/stone-giant) clans that have since been pushed deeper into the mountains. Conflicts between the giants and the settlers are common and usually violent.

### Othendin River
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Cliffkeep^ ^Mountains^](cliffkeep-mountains)

**^Type:^** ^Hill^ ^&^ ^Mountain^

The Othendin River is a long, broad river that begins high in the central [Cliffkeeps](cliffkeep-mountain-range) and runs along the northern slop of the southern range and down through the [Othendin Pass](othendin-pass). The river then turns west and makes for the northern [Ozmit Sea](ozmit-sea). The river is swift and rocky and while small boats can navigate most of it's 300 mile journey, moving upstream is easiest done on foot.

### Pools of Wittebak
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Cliffkeep^ ^Mountains^](cliffkeep-mountains)

**^Type:^** ^Hill^ ^&^ ^Mountain^

The Pools of Wittebak are a series of hot springs located to the northeast of the city of [Kraghammer](kraghammer) in the central range of the [Cliffkeep Mountains](cliffkeep-mountain-range). The pools sit directly above the ruined [gnomish](gnomes) city of [Wittebak](ruins-of-wittebak).

The pools are a favorite of local [hill giants](/monster/hill-giant) and it was their playing in the pools that lead to the destruction of [Wittebak](ruins-of-wittebak). Cracks opened up in the city and vented noxious gas into the city and killed thousands of [gnomes](gnomes) in a single night.

The survivors relocated to [Kraghammer](kraghammer) and the [giants](/monster/hill-giant) now claim dominion over the pools and view it as their ancestral home.

### Ruins of Wittebak
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Cliffkeep^ ^Mountains^](cliffkeep-mountains)

**^Type:^** ^Mountain^ ^&^ ^Underdark^

Located beneath the [Pools of Wittebak](pools-of-wittebak) is the ruined, [gnomish](gnomes) city of Wittebak. Once home to more than three thousand [gnomes](gnomes), Wittebak was destroyed around 415 PD when a clan of [hill giants](/monster/hill-giant) caused a crack to vent noxious gases into the city while they played in the [pools](pools-of-wittebak) above. Those that survived, moved to [Kraghammer](kraghammer) where they were welcomed, somewhat reluctantly by the insular [dwarves](dwarves).

The city is divided into three tiers, each with it's own challenges.

**Tinkerer's Tier**. The topmost level of Wittebak is breathable, but only to a point. A creature not accustomed to the environment can stand a number of hours equal to their constitution modifier before they start taking 1d6 poison damage for each minute beyond that.

Local [hill giants](/monster/hill-giant) have adapted to the gas and move about the top tier freely.

**Homesteads**. The second level is much more noxious and anyone down longer than an hour begins taking damage. The entire level is like a tomb with many of the long dead gnomes still interred here. Water leaks from the pools and falls above.

**Engine Core**. The lowest level is full of complex gearworks and industrial wonders, but it is flooded and crawling with [merrow](/monster/merrow) and is home to a [sea hag](/monster/sea-hag) named Mauvlettir and her lair.

### Serpent's Head
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Cliffkeep^ ^Mountains^](cliffkeep-mountains)

**^Type:^** ^Mountain,^ ^Forest,^ ^&^ ^Elemental^

Serpent's Head was a small, village located on a squat mountain of the same name in the southern range of the [Cliffkeep Mountains](cliffkeep-mountain-range) near the [Torian Forest](torian-forest). It was completely destroyed in 811 PD by [Thordak the Cinder King](thordak-the-cinder-king) for reasons unknown.

The village predominantly consisted of [dwarves](dwarves) and [humans](humans) and while most of the inhabitants fled to [Kraghammer](kraghammer) some stayed and perished in the ancient red dragon's assault. What little remains of the village is now a smoking volcano surrounded by fields of ash and cinders. Numerous dangerous creatures of the fire plane now call the nearby mines and caverns home.

{.sidebar}

The village of Terrah is located in the wide, bowl-like valley in the center of the sprawling [Cliffkeep Mountains](cliffkeep-mountain-range). The village is home to the druids of the [Earth Ashari](ashari), who guard the rift between the material plane of [Exandria](geography) and the Elemental Plan of Earth nearby.

##### Architecture
Despite being a small village, the architecture of Terrah consists of expertly crafted stone and and earth. Many of the [Earth Ashari](ashari) are expert masons and possess the ability to meld stone like clay. The result is highly refined, scultped structures that show no signs of chisel work.

##### Defenses
Terrah has no permanent defenses in the form of walls or fortifactions and no standing guard or militia. 

##### Demographics

##### Government
The village is governed by a leader called the "Heart of the Mountain". Selected by their predecessor, they must first pass a series of trials, known as an Aramente, to prove their worth.

##### Law & Order
Crime is virtually non-existent in Terrah. What squabbles or disagreements that arise are quickly settled by the "Heart of the Mountain".

##### Religion
The [Ashari](ashari) are not particularly religious, but there are many that worship [Melora](melora) and [Moradin](moradin) in Terrah.


##### Services
Services are extremely limited in Terrah. There is no need for inns, taverns, or most forms of shops and while there are a number of skilled artisans in Terrah, these are just one of many roles they provide to the community.

The Umbra Hills were once a lush and verdant landscape known as the Emerald Highlands. The hills were rich with minerals and wildlife and drew settlers from the [Dividing Plains](dividing-plains) to form the town of [Jorenn Village](jorenn-village) on the southern edge of the hills.

In the [Battle of the Umbra Hills](history), the combined forces of [Syngorn](syngorn) and [Zan Tal'Dorei](taldorei-zan) defeated the forces of [King Trist Drassig](drassig-trist) and [Graz'zt](grazzt-the-demon-prince-of-indulgence) to end the [Scattered War](history). In the aftermath, the hills were permanently scarred and nothing except the shadegrass, for which the hills are now famous will grow there.
