### Black Valley
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Cliffkeep^ ^Mountains^](cliffkeep-mountains) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Hill^ ^&^ ^Mountain^

The Black Valley is located between the [Gatshadow Spur](cliffkeep-mountain-range) of the [Cliffkeep Mountains](cliffkeep-mountain-range) and the lower end of the [Eastern Range](cliffkeep-mountain-range) that runs along the western shore of the [Dawnmist Bay](dawnmist-bay).

The valley begins at the the north end of the [Bramblewood](bramblewood) and extends up to the [Umbra Hills](umbra-hills) at the base of the [Cliffkeeps](cliffkeep-mountain-range). 

Prior to the [Scattered War](history), the hills at the northern end of the valley were known as the Emerald Highlands. After the Battle of the [Umbra Hills](umbra-hills) the hills were corrupted and the name changed.

### Black Valley Path
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Cliffkeep^ ^Mountains^](cliffkeep-mountains) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Hill^ ^&^ ^Mountain^

The Black Valley Path connects the settlement of [Jorenn Village](jorenn-village) on the edge of the [Umbra Hills](umbra-hills) to the rest of [Tal'Dorei](tal'dorei). It descends from the [Umbra Hills](umbra-hills) through the [Black Valley](black-valley) before joining the [Parchwood Way](parchwood-way) to head east to [Turst Fields](turst-fields) or southwest to [Westruun](westruun).

The Black Valley Path is not patrolled by any guard. The [Shadewatch](shadewatch) stop at the outskirts of [Jorenn Village](jorenn-village) and the [Shields of the Plains](shields-of-the-plains) rarely leave the [Parchwood Way](parchwood-way).

### Cliffkeep Mountain Range
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Cliffkeep^ ^Mountains^](cliffkeep-mountains) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Mountain^

The Cliffkeep Mountains is a massive mountain range that covers nearly one-third of the entire continent of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei). The entire range stretches from the [Dividing Plains](dividing-plains) in the center of the continent, all the way to the ice-cold [Frigid Depths](frigid-depths) far to the north. 

Due to its massive size, the Cliffkeeps are often subdivided into five distinct ranges.

##### Eastern Range
The eastern range of the Cliffkeeps runs along the western shore of the [Dawnmist Bay](dawnmist-bay) from the [Dawnmist Pines](dawnmist-pines) in the south, along the eastern side of the [Black Valley](black-valley) to the [Neverfields](neverfields).

##### Gatshadow Spur
The Gatshadow Spur is a range that shoots down between the southern and eastern ranges towards the [Dividing Plains](dividing-plains). It frames the western side of the [Black Valley](black-valley) and comes to an abrupt halt at the massive [Gatshadow](gatshadow).

##### Northern Range
The northern range of the Cliffkeeps runs up through the center of the region, along the western edge of the [Grey Valley](grey-valley) to the [Elvenpeaks](elvenpeaks) and the city of [Lyrengorn](lyrengorn).

##### Southern Range
The southern range of the Cliffkeeps begins at the [Othendin Pass](othendin-pass) and runs along the northern border of the [Torian Forest](torian-forest) and ends east of the dwarven city of [Kraghammer](kraghammer) at the start of the Gatshadow Spur. 

##### Western Range
The western range of the Cliffkeeps is located in the nortwestern corner of the region. It includes the small chain west of the [Othendin Pass](othendin-pass), breaks north of [Fort Daxio](fort-daxio) and continues north along the northwest coast of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei).

*^Canon^ ^Consistency:^ **^Medium^** ^-^ ^(Tal'Dorei^ ^Campaign^ ^Guide,^ ^p.^ ^80)^*

> Due to the sheer enormity of the Cliffkeep Mountains, the various ranges are known by many names to many peoples. While these ranges are not identified on any previous maps, I decided to adopt the logical names for these ranges as given by the [dwarves](dwarves) of [Kraghammer](kraghammer) and translated into Common.

### Elvenpeaks
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Cliffkeep^ ^Mountains^](cliffkeep-mountains) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Mountain^ ^&^ ^Arctic^

Despite it's name, the Elvenpeaks is a single mountain that has been split in the middle, by a long, slow-moving glacier. On either side of the glacier stand tall, rocky peaks. It lies at the far northern tip of the [Cliffkeep Mountains'](cliffkeep-mountain-range) northernmost range and it is the last major mountain before the endless frozen wastes of the [Neverfields](neverfields).

While the mountain and surrounding area are cold and inhospitable, a warm, temperate forest thrives beneath the ice sheet suspended between the peaks. Inside, lies the elven city of [Lyrengorn](lyrengorn), a bastion of elven culture far removed from the influence of [Syngorn](syngorn).

### Emerald Highlands
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Cliffkeep^ ^Mountains^](cliffkeep-mountains) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Hill^ ^&^ ^Mountain^

The Emerald Highlands refers to what is now known as the [Black Valley](black-valley) and [Umbra Hills](umbra-hills). The name was changed following the [Battle of the Umbra Hills](history). The name is out of use and can only be found in ancient texts.

### Gatshadow
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Cliffkeep^ ^Mountains^](cliffkeep-mountains) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Mountain^

Gatshadow is massive mountain located at the southern end of the [Gatshadow Spur](cliffkeep-mountain-range) of the [Cliffkeep Mountains](cliffkeep-mountain-range). It towers over the [Bramblewood](bramblewood) forest and serves as prominent landmark to travelers on the [Silvercut Roadway](silvercut-roadway) and [Wildwood Byway](wildwood-byway).

Small mining operations have exploited the neighboring hills and base, but few willingly venture into the mountain's many caverns and tunnels. A massive complex of passages, chambers, traps and monsters are rumored to lay deep within the heart of the mountain and that [Tharizdun the Chained Oblivion](tharizdun-the-chained-oblivion) may be imprisoned within or kept at bay by some form of shackle or seals.

### Grey Valley
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Cliffkeep^ ^Mountains^](cliffkeep-mountains) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Forest^ ^&^ ^Mountain^

The Grey Valley is a large valley that lies deep in the heart of the [Cliffkeep Mountains](cliffkeep-mountain-range). The valley is a dark and lifeless place, full of dead, petrified trees. 

After the Calamity, [Graz'zt the Demon Prince of Indulgence](grazzt-the-demon-prince-of-indulgence) called the valley home and it quickly began to take on his demonic influence.

During the Scattered War, [Graz'zt](grazzt-the-demon-prince-of-indulgence) was recruited to the forces of Trist Drassig and despite the Demon Prince's help, they were defeated by the combined forces of Zan Tal'Dorei and [Syngorn](syngorn) at the Battle of the [Umbra Hills](umbra-hills). In the aftermath, both the [Umbra Hills](umbra-hills) and Grey Valley were left corrupted and lifeless.

### Neverfields
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Cliffkeep^ ^Mountains^](cliffkeep-mountains) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Arctic^

The Neverfields is a massive arctic plain that lies to the north of the seemingly endless  [Cliffkeep Mountains](cliffkeep-mountains). A frozen wasteland, the Neverfields is a land of shifting ice, whirling snowstorms and biting cold. 

Despite the savage conditions, the Neverfields are not lifeless. The frozen wastes are home to many dangerous creatures and a few tribes, like the [Icewalkers](icewalkers), that venture in to the Neverfields to hunt them.

### Othendin Pass
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Cliffkeep^ ^Mountains^](cliffkeep-mountains) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Hill^ ^&^ ^Mountain^

Othendin Pass is a large valley that divides the southern and western ranges of the [Cliffkeep Mountains](cliffkeep-mountain-range). The area is newly settled by [human](humans) from the [Bladeshimmer Shoreline](bladeshimmer-shoreline) and has come under the protection of the [Republic of Tal'Dorei](republic-of-taldorei) with the construction of [Fort Daxio](fort-daxio) after the Scattered War.

The area was once home to a number of [stone giant](/monster/stone-giant) clans that have since been pushed deeper into the mountains. Conflicts between the giants and the settlers are common and usually violent.

### Othendin River
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Cliffkeep^ ^Mountains^](cliffkeep-mountains) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Hill^ ^&^ ^Mountain^

The Othendin River is a long, broad river that begins high in the central [Cliffkeeps](cliffkeep-mountain-range) and runs along the northern slop of the southern range and down through the [Othendin Pass](othendin-pass). The river then turns west and makes for the northern [Ozmit Sea](ozmit-sea). The river is swift and rocky and while small boats can navigate most of it's 300 mile journey, moving upstream is easiest done on foot.

### Pools of Wittebak
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Cliffkeep^ ^Mountains^](cliffkeep-mountains) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Hill^ ^&^ ^Mountain^

The Pools of Wittebak are a series of hot springs located to the northeast of the city of [Kraghammer](kraghammer) in the central range of the [Cliffkeep Mountains](cliffkeep-mountain-range). The pools sit directly above the ruined [gnomish](gnomes) city of [Wittebak](ruins-of-wittebak).

The pools are a favorite of local [hill giants](/monster/hill-giant) and it was their playing in the pools that lead to the destruction of [Wittebak](ruins-of-wittebak). Cracks opened up in the city and vented noxious gas into the city and killed thousands of [gnomes](gnomes) in a single night.

The survivors relocated to [Kraghammer](kraghammer) and the [giants](/monster/hill-giant) now claim dominion over the pools and view it as their ancestral home.

### Ruins of Wittebak
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Cliffkeep^ ^Mountains^](cliffkeep-mountains) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Mountain^ ^&^ ^Underdark^

Located beneath the [Pools of Wittebak](pools-of-wittebak) is the ruined, [gnomish](gnomes) city of Wittebak. Once home to more than three thousand [gnomes](gnomes), Wittebak was destroyed around 415 PD when a clan of [hill giants](/monster/hill-giant) caused a crack to vent noxious gases into the city while they played in the [pools](pools-of-wittebak) above. Those that survived, moved to [Kraghammer](kraghammer) where they were welcomed, somewhat reluctantly by the insular [dwarves](dwarves).

The city is divided into three tiers, each with it's own challenges.

**Tinkerer's Tier**. The topmost level of Wittebak is breathable, but only to a point. A creature not accustomed to the environment can stand a number of hours equal to their constitution modifier before they start taking 1d6 poison damage for each minute beyond that.

Local [hill giants](/monster/hill-giant) have adapted to the gas and move about the top tier freely.

**Homesteads**. The second level is much more noxious and anyone down longer than an hour begins taking damage. The entire level is like a tomb with many of the long dead gnomes still interred here. Water leaks from the pools and falls above.

**Engine Core**. The lowest level is full of complex gearworks and industrial wonders, but it is flooded and crawling with [merrow](/monster/merrow) and is home to a [sea hag](/monster/sea-hag) named Mauvlettir and her lair.

### Serpent's Head
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Cliffkeep^ ^Mountains^](cliffkeep-mountains) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Mountain,^ ^Forest,^ ^&^ ^Elemental^

Serpent's Head was a small, village located on a squat mountain of the same name in the southern range of the [Cliffkeep Mountains](cliffkeep-mountain-range) near the [Torian Forest](torian-forest). It was completely destroyed in 811 PD by [Thordak the Cinder King](thordak-the-cinder-king) for reasons unknown.

The village predominantly consisted of [dwarves](dwarves) and [humans](humans) and while most of the inhabitants fled to [Kraghammer](kraghammer) some stayed and perished in the ancient red dragon's assault. What little remains of the village is now a smoking volcano surrounded by fields of ash and cinders. Numerous dangerous creatures of the fire plane now call the nearby mines and caverns home.

### Umbra Hills
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Cliffkeep^ ^Mountains^](cliffkeep-mountains) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Hill^ ^&^ ^Mountain^

The Umbra Hills were once a lush and verdant landscape known as the Emerald Highlands. The hills were rich with minerals and wildlife and drew settlers from the [Dividing Plains](dividing-plains) to form the town of [Jorenn Village](jorenn-village) on the southern edge of the hills.

In the [Battle of the Umbra Hills](history), the combined forces of [Syngorn](syngorn) and [Zan Tal'Dorei](taldorei-zan) defeated the forces of [King Trist Drassig](drassig-trist) and [Graz'zt](grazzt-the-demon-prince-of-indulgence) to end the [Scattered War](history). In the aftermath, the hills were permanently scarred and nothing except the shadegrass, for which the hills are now famous will grow there.

### Wildwood
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Cliffkeep^ ^Mountains^](cliffkeep-mountains) {.screen-only}

**^Type:^** ^Forest^

The Wildwood forest is a small and peaceful wood located east of the [dwarven](dwarves) city of [Kraghammer](kraghammer). It is an important source of timber and game for the city and many [Toppers](toppers) live in small villages on the western edge of the forest.
