A module is a collection of pages, encounters, and maps that can be quickly and easily imported into Encounter+. They can be reference materials, adventures, or any number of tools that can help run a D&D session more efficiently.

If I have somehow inadvertently used your work and/or not given you appropriate credit, I apologize.

### Cartography
All of the maps in this module were created by me based on official sources and made with [Wonderdraft](https://www.wonderdraft.net/). In the event I use a map from another source, I will credit the artist and/or source.

### Images
The old saying, "A picture is worth a thousand words" has never been more true than when it comes to a DM trying to paint a mental picture to their players. Given a choice between 'boxed text' and a picture of what I'm trying to describe, I'll choose a picture 9 times out of 10. For that reason, I've tried to include images for most of the pages in this module. 

To avoid copyright infringment issues, I've made a concious decision to only include photos and artwork from one of three sources.
1. [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/) - All images are available completely free. 
2. Artwork from official Dungeons & Dragons source materials are included under the terms of the [Wizards of the Coast Fan Content Policy](https://company.wizards.com/fancontentpolicy).
3. I regularly reach out to artists for the purpose of including their work in this module. If I receive their permission, I will indicate as much on the page on which their work appears. 

*While the [Wizards of the Coast Fan Content Policy](https://company.wizards.com/fancontentpolicy) does not require crediting the original artist of artwork included in their materials, I would like to. If you see an image and know the artist, let me know. I'll add a caption and hopefully direct more people their way.*
