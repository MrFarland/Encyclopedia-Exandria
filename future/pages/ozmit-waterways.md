### Ozmit Waterways
The Ozmit Waterways are a series of canals that twist through the lower portions of the city of Emon. The waterways were primarily designed to help with drainage and storm-surge, but to the residents of Emon they are largely ornamental. The cleanliness of the waterways depends greatly on the district.
