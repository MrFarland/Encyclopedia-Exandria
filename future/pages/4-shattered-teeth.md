# Shattered Teeth

The [Shattered Teeth](shattered-teeth) is an archipelago of hundreds of islands scattered across the southeastern [Lucidian Ocean](lucidian-ocean). Very little is known about this island chain as it is hidden behind the perpetual fog of the [Fool's Curtain](fools-curtain). 

There is very little trade & travel between the [Shattered Teeth](shattered-teeth) and the rest of [Exandria](exandria), but a few captains out of the [Menagerie Coast](menagerie-coast) of [Wildemount](wildemount) are willing to brave the [Curtain](fools-curtain).

> We know virtually nothing about the islands or it's people. The maps we have our suspect and most of the stories are as reliable as rumor. I do not believe I will make it to the [Shattered Teeth](shattered-teeth) any time soon.
