# Issylra
[Issylra](issylra) is the largest and oldest continent in the world of [Exandria](exandria). Founded at the end of [Exandria's](exandria) first age, the "Dawn City" of [Vasselheim](vasselheim) stands as a beacon of civilization in the otherwise cold and savage region of [Othanzia](othanzia) in northern [Issylra](issylra).

While the roots of civilization on [Exandria](exandria) have their roots in [Issylra](issylra), the continent is sparsely populated and largely unexplored. Most of the continent's inhabitants reside in the northern half of the continent in the region known as [Othanzia](othanzia). 

A number of smaller nations and peoples are known to reside in [southern Issylra](southern-issylra), but we know very little about this part of the world.

##### Regions
The continent of [Issylra](issylra) is divided into three regions:
- [Othanzia](othanzia)
- [Southern Issylra](southern-issylra)

> I have not had an opportunity to tavel to [Issylra](issylra) myself and have had to rely on what little information is currently available on the continent. At present, this is just some information on the city of [Vasselheim](vasselheim) and the Ashari village of [Vesrah](vesrah).

> I hope to make the journey in the future and will update the maps and atlas once I have seen the continent for myself.
