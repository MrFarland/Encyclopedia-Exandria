### Undervaults
The Undervaults are a network of catacombs beneath the graveyards on the surface designed to hold the remains of the dead. While the Undervaults added additional burial space within the city, it is still at a premium and a luxury for the upper middle class.

The undervaults are guarded by the [Gravewatchers Guild](gravewatchers).

It is rumored that an entrance to the Crystalfen Caverns is located within the catacombs.
