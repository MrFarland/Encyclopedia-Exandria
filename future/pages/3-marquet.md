# Marquet
[Marquet](marquet) is the smallest of the four major continents and the least populated. The vast majority of [Marquet](marquet) is covered in sand, as the great [Marquessian Desert](marquessian-desert) dominates the center of the continent.

##### Regions
The continent of [Marquet](marquet) is divided into five regions:

- [Aggrad Mountains](aggrad-mountains)
- [Marquessian Desert](marquessian-desert)
- [Smouldercrown Mountains](smouldercrown-mountains)
- [Western Marquet](western-marquet).

> I have not had an opportunity to tavel to [Marquet](marquet) myself and have had to rely on what little information is currently available on the continent. At present, this is just some information on the city of [Ank'Harel](ankharel) and the [Shammel](shammel) on the [Bay of Gifts](bay-of-gifts) in northern [Marquet](marquet).
