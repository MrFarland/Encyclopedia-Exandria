### Bladeshimmer Bay
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Bladeshimmer^ ^Shoreline^](bladeshimmer-shoreline)

**^Type:^** ^Coastal^ ^-^ **^Danger:^** ^Medium^

The Bladeshimmer Bay is a large, open bay on the west coast of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei). It stretches from the Seashale Mountains in the north, down the [Bladeshimmer Shoreline](bladeshimmer-shoreline) and ends at a point due west of Daggerbay. The Bladeshimmer Bay is not sheltered from the open [Ozmit Sea](ozmit-sea), but the waters are relatively calm and the weather temperate. 

##### Flora & Fauna
The Bladeshimmer Bay is home to many species of marine mammals including seals, dolphins, and whales. The bay is a diverse ecosystem teeming with fish, mollusks, sea turtles, and shore birds. Competing with the local fishers out of Emon are a number of predators including [hunter sharks](/monster/hunter-shark), [killer whales](/monster/killer-whale), and [sea lions](/monster/sea-lion).

A number of different varieties of kelp thrive in the bay and can grow as large as terrestial trees. Kelp forests are scattered throughout the bay.

### Crystalfen Caverns
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Bladeshimmer^ ^Shoreline^](bladeshimmer-shoreline)

**^Type:^** ^Underdark^

Crystalfen Caverns is a massive network of underground tunnels, caverns, and rivers that date back to [Exandria's](exandria) founding. Home to an ancient aboleth civilization, the Crystalfen Caverns are extremely perilous. The Crystalfen Caverns are home to the ancient aboleth city of [Salar](ruins-of-salar), a city nearly destroyed during the Calamity, but slowly being rebuilt.

Throughout the caverns are veins of blue crystal called azuremite. This blue crystal can be ground and refined into a powder with powerful arcane properties called [Suude](/item/suude).

### Daggerbay
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Bladeshimmer^ ^Shoreline^](bladeshimmer-shoreline)

**^Type:^** ^Coastal^ ^&^ ^Underwater^

Daggerbay is a small bay on the southern end of the [Bladeshimmer Shoreline](bladeshimmer-shoreline). The bay is sheltered from the rough waters of the southern [Ozmit Sea](ozmit-sea), but the entrance is well guarded by the jagged and dangerous [Slumber Reef](slumber-reef). 

The bay was once home to the colony of [O'noa](ruins-of-onoa), the first permanent, [human](humans) settlement on [Tal'Dorei](taldorei) following the Calamity. After O'Noa was destroyed during the [Scattered War](history), both the city and the bay were abandoned in favor of the already more prosperous Emon.

Over time, the bay became a haven for pirates and [sahuagin](/monster/sahuagin) with the occassional foolhardy treasure hunter looking to salvage treasure from the countless wrecks on the [Slumber Reef](slumber-reef).

### Daggerbay Mountains
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Bladeshimmer^ ^Shoreline^](bladeshimmer-shoreline)

**^Type:^** ^Mountain^ ^&^ ^Hill^

The Daggerbay Mountains are jagged, rocky peaks located on the southern end of the [Bladeshimmer Shoreline](bladeshimmer-shoreline). Due east of Daggerbay, the mountains serve as a border between the [elven](elves) nation of [Syngorn](syngorn) and the [human](humans) [Republic of Tal'Dorei](council-of-taldorei). 

Located on the northern end of range, the [Emerald Outpost](emerald-outpost) keeps watch over the Emerald Path and protects the valuable trade caravans that pass between the two nations. 

Clans of [stone](/monster/stone-giant) and [hill](/monster/hill-giant) giants regularly harass travelers and raid supply wagons, as do [bandits](/monster/bandits) operating out of the [ruins of O'Noa](ruins-of-onoa).

{.sidebar}

The Emerald Outpost is a fortress located in the northern Daggerbay Mountains. The outpost was originally created to defend [Syngorn](syngorn) against the growing Drassig Empire, but it is now used primarily as a trading post between the [human](council-of-taldorei) and [elven](wardens-of-syngorn) states.

The administrative heart of the outpost is the old war room, known as the Emerald Chambers.

##### Architecture
While the elven architecture is less stark and martial than a comparable [human](humans) or [dwarven](dwarves) outpost might be, there is no doubt the facility was created for war. All of the structures are built with flowing grace and a style reminiscent of [Syngorn](Syngorn), but with greater emphasis on function and security.

##### Defenses
The Emerald Outpost is protected by large, expertly crafted stone walls, tall towers, and heavy, reinforced gates. The entire settlement is encircled and an inner wall protects the administrative and military center of the town.

Overall defense of the outpost falls to the [Verdant Guard](verdant-guard), but a small detatchment of soldiers from the [Army of Tal'Dorei](army-of-taldorei) are permanently assigned to the outpost.

##### Demographics

##### Government
While the Emerald Outpost is owned and maintained by the [Wardens of Syngorn](wardens-of-syngorn), command of the outpost is shared with the [Council of Tal'dorei](council-of-taldorei) as a show of collaboration and partnership. 

Day-to-day management of the outpost is handled by the respective captains of the [Verdant Guard](verdant-guard) and the [Army of Tal'Dorei](army-of-taldorei). The arrangement works, but petty rivalries and squabbles are not uncommon.

##### Law & Order
Random, violent crime is virtually unheard of inside the Outpost. Public drunkenness, the occassional bar fight, and black market trading are more common issues.

Military matters are mostly solved internally, while judicial matters involving civilians or between the two militaries are decided by the Captains.

##### Religion
Small shrines to many of the [Prime Deities](pantheon) can be found within the outpost, but the only full-time clergy serve [Corellon](corellon-the-arch-heart), [Bahamut](bahamut-the-platinum-dragon), and [Erathis](erathis).

The shrine to [Avandra](avandra) receives a great deal of visitors as she is favored by travelers, merchants, and the small [halfling](halflings) population that live there.

##### Services
The Emerald Outpost is roughly the size of a large village or small town, but it's role as a military outpost and major trade hub guarantees the avilability of certain services, typically not found in such a small settlement. Even rarer services can be found in the outpost if the right merchant happens to be passing through.

> ***Note:** Support value is the # of people needed to support a given service. This is just a helpful guide. There are always execptions. Also, a settlement too small for a dedicated service, does not mean that service is not available.*
<!-- {blockquote: .paper} -->

##### Society
While [elven](elves) and [human](humans) culture sometimes clash in other settlements, the soldiers of the [Verdant Guard](verdant-guard) and [Army of Tal'Dorei](army-of-taldorei) have much more in common than their civilian counterparts. In fact, the most common clashes are between the warrior culture of the soldiers and the "soft" civilians that pass through.

##### Trade & Industry
Nearly all trade between Emon and [Syngorn](syngorn) passes through the Emerald Outpost. It is a bustling trade center where merchants from both cities can buy and sell goods from the other.

Despite its relatively small size, the Emerald Outpost typically has goods only found in settlements two to three times it's size.

### Emerald Path
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Bladeshimmer^ ^Shoreline^](bladeshimmer-shoreline)

**^Type:^** ^Coastal^ ^&^ ^Grassland^

The Emerald Path is the main road that leads from the [human](humans) city of Emon to the [elven](elves) city of [Syngorn](syngorn). It winds its way down the [Bladeshimmer Shoreline](bladeshimmer-shoreline) passing close to the [Ruins of O'Noa](onoa) before turning east toward the Daggerbay Mountains and the [Emerald Outpost](emerald-outpost). It continues through the mountains and joins the [Wildwood Byway](wildwood-byway) on it's way south to [Syngorn](syngorn).

The Emerald Path is well patrolled by both the [Arms of Emon](arms-of-emon) and the [Verdant Guard](verdant-guard). The stretches nearest Emon, [Emerald Outpost](emerald-outpost) and [Syngorn](syngorn) being the safest. The stretch through the Daggerbay Mountains is heavily patrolled, but is still quite dangerous. Likewise, the stretch nearest the ruined city of [O'noa](ruins-of-onoa) is plagued by bandits operating out of the ancient ruined city.

### Emerald River
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Bladeshimmer^ ^Shoreline^](bladeshimmer-shoreline)

**^Type:^** ^Grassland^

The Emerald River is a shallow, rocky river that descends from the Daggerbay Mountains south of the [Emerald Outpost](emerald-outpost) and out onto the plains of the [Bladeshimmer Shoreline](bladeshimmer-shoreline). It travels west nearly 150 miles where it joins the Ivyheart Run before emptying into the [Ozmit Sea](ozmit-sea).

The Emerald River is navigable via small boats for much of its lower course. It starts as a rushing torrent of water in the Daggerbay Mountains, but quickly widens and shallows as it hits the plains. 

The Emerald Path follows the river for most of its course before diverging at the base of the mountains and heading due east to the [Emerald Outpost](emerald-outpost).

{.sidebar}

The city of Emon is located on the western shore of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei), on the northern end of the [Bladeshimmer Shoreline](bladeshimmer-shoreline). The city is the largest on the continent and the heart of the [Tal'Dorei Republic](council-of-taldorei) both politically and culturally. 

The city is divided into ten districts.

**Abdar's Promenade**. Located on the eastern side of the city, Abdar's Promenade is the marketplace district where nearly anything can be purchased.
- [Anvilgate](anvilgate)
- [Gilmore's Glorious Goods](gilmores-glorious-goods)
- [Laughing Lamia Inn](laughing-lamia-inn)

**Cemetary District**. The cemetary district is home to the city's tombs, mausoleums, and graveyards. It is largely run and protected by the [Gravewatchers Guild](gravewatchers).
- [Tomb of the Last Sovereign](tomb-of-the-last-sovereign)
- [Undervaults](undervaults)

**Central District**. The largest of the districts, the Central is home to Emon's lower middle class. While not as economically depressed as the slums, the Central District is rife with crime.
- [Azalea Street Park](azalea-street-park)
- [Grotto](grotto)
- [Ozmit Waterways](ozmit-waterways)

**Cloudtop District**. The Cloudtop is the highest point in the city physically, economically, and politically. It is home to the palace, the skyport, and the wealthy elite that rule Emon and all of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei).
- [Citrine Garrison](citrine-garrison)
- [Emon Skyport](emon-skyport)
- [Ivory Tower](ivory-tower)
- [Palace of the Sovereign](palace-of-the-sovereign)
- [Thordak's Crater](thordaks-crater)

**Erudite Quarter**. Home to the prestigious [Alabaster Lyceum](alabaster-lyceum), the Erudite is home to educational institutions and the scholars that run them. It is patrolled by the [Arms of Emon](arms-of-emon) and the [Lyceum's](alabaster-lyceum) private guards.
- [Alabaster Lyceum](alabaster-lyceum)
- [Traverse Junction](alabaster-lyceum)

**Military District**. The Military District is devoted to the housing and training of Emon's and [Tal'Dorei's] protectors. The [Arms of Emon](arms-of-emon) and the [Army of Tal'Dorei](army-of-taldorei). It is also home to the city's prison.
- [Black Bastille](black-bastille)
- [House of Discipline](house-of-discipline)
- [Walls of Tribute](walls-of-tribute)

**Port of Emon**. The Port of Emon is a the lifeblood of the city and much of the continent. Fishing and trade are the dominant industries in the district and tension between them is commonplace. The district is largely controlled by the rival [Everline](everline) & [Onyx Banner](onyx-banner) guilds.

**Temple District**. While there are smaller temples and shrines scattered throughout the city, the Temple District is home to the grand cathedrals and temples to the various deities worshipped by the people.
- [Godsbrawl Ring](godsbrawl-ring)

**Upper Slums**. Located just outside the north gate, the Upper Slums are rife with crime and poverty. It is a dangerous place to be after dark and the [Clasp](clasp) has a firm grasp on the entire district.
- [Grotto](grotto)

**Lower Slums**. The Lower Slums of Emon are equally as poor as the Upper Slums, but with significantly less crime. The entire district is focused on farming and food production and less urban.

**Shoreline Farms**. Located along the [Ozmit Sea](ozmit-sea) to the nortwest of the city, the Shoreline Farms district is booming. Rare fruits and vegetables that only grow in the brackish water support the local economy.

**Surrounding Areas**. Villages radiate out from the city for quite some distance. Fishing villages can be found up and down the coast while farming and logging villages can be found a day or two's walk east of the city.
- [Greyskull Keep](greyskull-keep)

##### Architecture
The city of Emon is not easily defined by its architecture. Most of the old buildings have a distinctive [human](humans) style, but [dwarven](dwarves) and [elven](elves) architectural styles are also quite prevalent. The end result is a kind of fusion that is unique to Emon.

##### Defenses
The city of Emon is surrounded by a large semi-circular stone wall that runs from the northwestern corner of the city, around the eastern side of the city and ends on the south side of the city. Slightly smaller walls with gates separate the interior districts of the city.

The city is policed and defended by the highly trained [Arms of Emon](arms-of-emon). In addition to the "Arms", the elite [Citrine Garrison](citrine-garrison) guards the Cloudtop District while the [Gravewatchers](gravewatchers) and [Alabaster Lyceum's private security](alabaster-lyceum) keep an eye on the Cemetary and Erudite districts respectively.

##### Demographics

##### Government
While day-to-day administration of the city is left to a well-established bureacracy, overall governance of the city passes to the quasi-democratic oligarchy known as the [Council of Tal'Dorei](council-of-taldorei).

##### Law & Order
The [Arms of Emon](arms-of-emon) are responsible for policiing the city. Each district has its own combination barracks, courthouse, and jail. A local magistrate and a barracks captain that commands the [Arms](arms-of-emon) for the district.

Crime is rampant in some parts of the city, but very little happens in Emon without the [Clasp's](clasp) knowledge. They have a heavy presence in the Central District and both slums.

##### Religion
[Erathis](erathis) and [Bahamut](bahamut-the-platinum-dragon) are the dominant gods in Emon, but all of the [Prime Deities](pantheon) have a strong following. Given the sheer size of the city, it is not hard to believe a number of temples and shrines to the various [Betrayer Gods](betrayer-gods) can be found throughout the city.

Most of the main temples can be found in the Temple District, but smaller temples and shrines are scattered throughout the city.

##### Services
There are very few things in the world of [Exandria](geography) that cannot be bought in the city of Emon. Artisans, scholars, and merchants of all types can be found in nearly every corner of the city. Anything you can't find in the smaller, residential neighborhoods can usually be found in the merchant district of Abdar's Promenade.

##### Society
Once a bastion of [human](humans) civilization, Emon is now a much more diverse, metropolis. While the elite in the Cloudtop and Erudite view and promote the city as a shining example of civilized, culture society the city is not without its issues.

The divide between the classes is wide and there are still some within the city that harbor the old biases against non-human races once harbored under the Drassigs.

##### Trade & Industry
Emon's economy is largely based on trade and services. The city is a massive trade center with much of the continent's wealth passing through the Port of Emon.

While there is some heavy industry outside the city, raw materials like timber, stone, and metals are largely imported. The chief exports are food and finished goods.

### Flamereach Grove
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Bladeshimmer^ ^Shoreline^](bladeshimmer-shoreline)

**^Type:^** ^Forest^ ^&^ ^Elemental^

Flamereach Grove is a small forest located about a day's walk east of the city of Emon. The forest was known as the [Shivergreen Grove](shivergreen-grove) until [Thordak the Cinder King](thordak-cinder-king) and the [Chroma Conclave](chroma-conclave) attacked in 815 PD. 

After the attack the surrounding area was turned into the "Scar of the Cinder King" and the forest continues to burn to this day. The trees in the forest are charred black and the forest floor is covered in continuously burning embers and ash.

The forest sits on the edge of the [Snowember Fields](snowember-fields) and a squat, stone fortress called the [Flamereach Outpost](flamereach-outpost) keeps watch over both.

{.sidebar}

Fort Daxio is a large fortress located at the northern end of the [Othendin Pass](othendin-pass). The fort was established shortly after the Scattered War to protect the settlements and mining operations in the area from giant clans.

The fortress is operated by the [Army of Tal'Dorei](army-of-taldorei) and houses four of the army's regiments. Each regiment consists of 1,100 soliders each and while two regiments are often deployed to other parts of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei) at any given time, the fort can support all 4,400 troops plus an additional 500 civilians.

**Interior**: Nearly all of the fort's amenties and living quarters are located inside the mountains.
- [Watchman's Rest](watchmans-rest) 

**Surrounding Area**: Not much is known about the area around the fort, but it is assumed there are small settlements, some mines, and farms struggling to grow crops in the hard, rocky soil.

##### Architecture
Fort Daxio is a military installation where the focus is on utility and function instead of beauty. Everything is crafted from stone and hardened. Even the interior of the fort is utilitarian and rather bland.

##### Defenses
Fort Daxio is a massive fortress built directly into the side of the mountains. It has high, thick stone walls and there is only one gate. Ballista and trebuchets are located on the walls.

Inside the walls, a large central keep juts out from the side of the mountain with much of its interior underground. A heavy gate is the only way in, but it is expected there are secret ways out of the citadel either up on to the ridge behind or further down the valley.

##### Demographics

##### Government
Fort Daxio is a military complex governed by the [Army of Tal'Dorei](army-of-taldorei). Overall command resides with the Warmaster of the [Council of Tal'Dorei](council-of-taldorei) during times of war and the Master of Defense during peace time.

##### Law & Order
Fort Daxio is located in a remote corner of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei) and home to thousands of soldiers. Violent crime is virtually non-existent, but drunken and disorderly conduct and the occassional scuffle between soldiers is not uncommon.

##### Religion
[Bahamut](bahamut) and [Erathis](erathis) are the dominant gods in the fortress, but [Kord](kord) is also quite popular among the soldiers. [Moradin](moradin) and [Corellon](corellon) are also present among the [dwarven](dwarves) and [elven](elves) soldiers.

Only [Bahamut](bahamut) and [Erathis](erathis) have full-time [priests](/monster/priest) and dedicated shrines in the fortress.

##### Services
Nearly all of the services at Fort Daxio are operated by the military for the military. While they will sell and do work for civilians, the needs of the army come first and some things are not available to outsiders.

> ***Note:** Support value is the # of people needed to support a given service. This is just a helpful guide. There are always execptions. Also, a settlement too small for a dedicated service, does not mean that service is not available.*
<!-- {blockquote: .paper} -->

##### Society
Military life permeates all aspects of life at Fort Daxio. Organization, efficiency, structure, and discipline are core values throughout the settlement. Everything has a purpose and everything has its place. There is very little room for luxury and frivolity.

This culture extends to the civilians living inside the fortress, as well as those in the surrounding communities. Many served in the [army](army-of-taldorei) themselves and the [Othendin Pass](othendin-pass) is a very dangerous place. 

##### Trade & Industry
Fort Daxio is largely self-sufficient in terms of basic raw materials and food. The farms, logging camps, and mines in the area are largely dedicated to supporting the garrison and its troops. Very little is left over to export. 

While the fort is capable of producing basic items, refined finished goods are imported from Emon and [Kraghammer](kraghammer).

### Ivyheart Run
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Bladeshimmer^ ^Shoreline^](bladeshimmer-shoreline)

**^Type:^** ^Forest^ ^&^ ^Grassland^

Ivyheart Run is a small river that begins deep within the Ivyheart Thicket of the [Dividing Plains](dividing-plains) and heads west over the plains of the [Bladeshimmer Shoreline](bladeshimmer-shoreline) to the [Ozmit Sea](ozmit-sea).

The Ivyheart Run is not a big, deep, or fast-moving river, but it is navigable via small boat for much of its 300 mile course. Wide open grasslands and the occassional grove of trees line the banks. 

Shortly before it's arrival at the sea, the Run joins with the Emerald River north of the ruined city of [O'Noa](ruins-of-onoa).

### Nightwash Tide
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Bladeshimmer^ ^Shoreline^](bladeshimmer-shoreline)

**^Type:^** ^Coastal^ ^&^ ^Mountain^

The Nightwash Tide is a series of interconnected bays, coves and lagoons at the base of theSeashale Mountains on the northern end of the [Bladeshimmer Shoreline](bladeshimmer-shoreline). Many of these bays extend deep into the heart of the mountains and twist and turn into a labyrinth of brackish water.

The Nightwash is a seemingly endless supply of food for the villages of the [Shalesteps](shalesteps) and their chief export. Fish and other marine life is washed in with the tide from the [Ozmit Sea](ozmit-sea) and trapped in the lagoon. Fishers from the nearby village of [Puddlefoot](shalesteps) rarely have to venture out into the open-water to fill their nets for the day.

Fishing the Nightwash is not without risks. The same tide that brings in fish, occassionally brings in creatures a little too dangerous for the fishers to deal with on their own.

### Othendin Trail
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Bladeshimmer^ ^Shoreline^](bladeshimmer-shoreline)

**^Type:^** ^Grassland^ ^&^ ^Mountain^

The Othendin Trail is a long road that winds its way north from the bustling city of Emon, past the [Shalestep Mountains](shalestep-mountains) and on to the [Othendin Pass](othendin-pass). For the soldiers stationed at [Fort Daxio](fort-daxio), it is their only connection to Emon and the [Council of Tal'Dorei](council-of-taldorei).

The trail is heavily patrolled by the [Arms of Emon](arms-of-emon) near the city and by the [army](army-of-taldorei) in the pass, but is relatively unguarded for much of its length. Fortunately, the regularity of military traffic and supply caravans does provide some degree of protection to travelers.

### Ruins of O'Noa


### Ruins of Salar
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Bladeshimmer^ ^Shoreline^](bladeshimmer-shoreline)

**^Type:^** ^Underdark^

The city of Salar was once a great [aboleth](/monster/aboleth) city located deep within the Crystalfen Caverns beneath the [Bladeshimmer Shoreline](bladeshimmer-shoreline). The city thrived during the Age of Arcanum but was nearly destroyed during the Calamity. The city is a shadow of its former self, but it is rebuilding.

The architecture of Salar is completely alien to the [races](races) of Exandria. Those who know of its existence call it the "Unseeable City" because those who look upon it are known to have descended into madness. The city is illuminated by a massive pearlescent disc, called the Moon Disc.

### Ruins of Vos'Sykriss
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Bladeshimmer^ ^Shoreline^](bladeshimmer-shoreline)

**^Type:^** ^Jungle^

Vos'Sykriss was a large city located on the larger of the two islands known as [Visa Isle](visa-isle). It was the capital city and crowning jewel of a [Yuan-Ti](yuan-ti) civilization and it dominated the coast of southwestern [Tal'Dorei](tal'dorei). 

The [Yuan-Ti](yuan-ti) civilization fell during the [Calamity](history) and much of the city of Vos'Sykriss' fell into ruin. Over time, what remained of the [Yuan-Ti](yuan-ti) simply vanished from the face of [Exandria](geography).

Undead [Yuan-Ti](yuan-ti) still patrol and defend their ancestral home, while countless others lie in a form of stasis or hibernation deep within the ancient halls of the city. 

In the early 800s, an expedition from the [Alabaster Lyceum](alabaster-lyceum) explored the ruined city and brought back many artifacts. Shortly after their departure, the [Yuan-Ti](yuan-ti) began to awaken from their slumber.

### Scar of the Cinder King

**^Type:^** ^Forest,^ ^Grassland,^ ^&^ ^Elemental^

The Scar of the Cinder King refers to an area east of Emon that was ravaged by [Thordak](thordak) during the [Chroma Conclave's](chroma-conclave) assault in 812 P.D. The area includes the ever-burning Flamereach Grove, [Snowember Fields](snowember-fields), and the [Flamereach Outpost](flamereach-outpost). 

The area is heavily scarred and cursed by elemental magic. Creatures from the [Elemental Plane of Fire](elemental-plane-of-fire) roam the area and druids from the Fire [Ashari](ashari) of [Pyrah](pyrah) and scholars from the [Alabaster Lyceum](alabaster-lyceum) are working together to monitor the area and hopefully reverse the damage.

The Shalesteps is not a single settlement, but a number of allied villages scattered throughout the southern Seashale Mountains northwest of Emon.

**Puddlefoot**. Puddlefoot is a small fishing village located at the base of the [Seashales](seashales) on the southern side of the [Nightwash](nightwash-tide). It is mostly [human](humans) and [halfling](halflings) with a few [dwarves](dwarves). It is the largest of the allied villages and the closest to Emon.

> ***Note:** There are no other individual villages named in official sources. It is implied there are three, but there could easily be more.*
<!-- {blockquote: .paper} -->

##### Architecture
Architecture varies from village to village and is largely based on the location, focus, and dominant race in that village. 
- The mostly [human](humans) fishing villages along the [Nightwash](nightwash) are simple wooden shacks and huts built on stilts. 
- The villages more inland and focused on farming favor more traditional [halfling](halflings) style cottages and burrows.
- The mountain villages focused on mining and hunting are built into the mountainside and reminiscent of dwarven settlements in the [Cliffkeeps](cliffkeep-mountains).

##### Defenses
None of the villages are fortified, but all employ some form of volunteer watch and alarm. Similarly, all of the villages aid in each other's defense.

##### Demographics

##### Government
Each village is led by an elected "Elder" who then represents that village in a grand council of all the villages.

##### Law & Order
Crime, outside of the occassional fight or public drunkenness, is unheard of in the Shalesteps. Criminal and civil disputes are decided by jury trial, presided over by the village "Elder".

##### Religion
The most commonly followed gods in the Shalesteps are [Melora](melora), [Avandra](avandra), [Kord](kord) and [Pelor](pelor). There may be 1 or 2 [acolytes](/monster/acolyte) among the villages of the Shalesteps, but there are no dedicated temples or clergy.

##### Services
There are very few shops in the villages of the Shalesteps. A small general store and blacksmith in Puddlefoot service all of the other villages. Likewise, there are no inns or taverns. 

##### Society
The Shalesteps are a very tight-knit community. The individual villages may only have a handful of families in each one and marriages often involve couples from different villages. Nearly everyone you meet has a cousin or sibling in another village.

The people of the Shalesteps are wary of outsiders, but are friendly and welcoming.

##### Trade & Industry
While the individual villages are quite small and rural, the Shalesteps do a great deal of business with nearby Emon. They provide the city with a great deal of seafood, produce, stone, and wild game.

Locally, the Shalesteps has little to offer in terms of goods and services. 

> While the majority of this page is canon, some details like the settlement's land area, number of guards, and available services are based on the guide "Medieval Demographics Made Easy". They help develop the settlement in ways that are not provided in canon sources, but do so in a believable manner. Some details have been added and expanded upon.

### Seashale Mountains
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Bladeshimmer^ ^Shoreline^](bladeshimmer-shoreline)

**^Type:^** ^Mountain^ ^&^ ^Coastal^

The Seashale Mountains are a small mountain range located northwest of the city of Emon on the northern edge of the [Bladeshimmer Shoreline](bladeshimmer-shoreline). The mountains have an unnatural shape similar to that of a rolling tide and the mountains are tall, rocky, and jagged. 

On the southwestern base of the mountains is the Nightwash Tide and the collection of villages known as the [Shalesteps](shalesteps).

### Shivergreen Grove
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Bladeshimmer^ ^Shoreline^](bladeshimmer-shoreline)

**^Type:^** ^Forest^

The Shivergreen Gove was a small forest about a day's walk east of the city of Emon. It was a relatively safe wood, surrounded by small farming villages and just off the [Silvercut Roadway](silvercut-roadway). Farming villages dotted the countryside and the grove was an important source of game and timber.

In 815 PD, the forest was destroyed by Thordak the Cinder King and transformed into the ever-burning Flamereach Grove. The surrounding farmland transformed into the [Snowember Fields](snowember-fields).

### Slumber Reef
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Bladeshimmer^ ^Shoreline^](bladeshimmer-shoreline)

**^Type:^** ^Coastal^ ^&^ ^Underwater^

Slumber Reef is a large natural reef that guards the entrance to Daggerbay. The sharp rocks and hidden coral reef make entering the bay dangerous for ships, but the shelter it provides was instrumental in the success of the early settlement of [O'Noa](ruins-of-onoa). 

Safely navigating through the reef takes skill and many a captain confident in their abilities has found themselves swimming to shore among the many sharks and creatures that call the reef home.

### Snowember Fields
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Bladeshimmer^ ^Shoreline^](bladeshimmer-shoreline)

**^Type:^** ^Grassland^ ^&^ ^Elemental^

Located within the area east of Emon known as the Scar of the Cinder King, the Snowember Fields is a large tract of farmland ruined by the ancient red dragon [Thordak](thordak). The entire area is covered in white ash with the occassional burnt farmhouse or barn. From a distance the Snowember looks like a snowy plain. Underneath this ash, however are ever-smoldering embers.

Creatures from the [Elemental Plane of Fire](elemental-plane-of-fire) live beneath the ash and travelling through the fields runs the risk of disturbing them.

*^Canon^ ^Consistency:^ ^High^ ^-^ ^(Tal'Dorei^ ^Campaign^ ^Guide,^ ^p.^ ^96)^*


> In the Tal'Dorei Campaign Guide, the author indicates a [magmin](/monster/magmin) will spring from the ash for every 5 feet walked in the fields. This must be an exageration. A simple trek by a party of four a 1/2 mile into the fields would spawn 2,118 [magmin](/monster/magmin).
>
> In my experience, we tended to encounter them a lot less frequently. Every hour we had about a 10% chance of disturbing some elemental creatures such as: [magmin](/monster/magmin), [cinderslags](/monster/cinderslag-elementals), and even some [fire elementals](/monster/fire-elementals).*

### Visa Isle
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Bladeshimmer^ ^Shoreline^](bladeshimmer-shoreline)

**^Type:^** ^Jungle^ ^&^ ^Coastal^

Visa Isle is actually two seperate islands located off the coast of the [Bladeshimmer Shoreline](bladeshimmer-shoreline) and [Verdant Expanse](verdant-expanse) in the [Ozmit Sea](ozmit-sea). 

The islands are highly volcanic with active volcanos spewing ash into the sky. Everything from the base of the peaks to the black sand beaches is covered in thick, tropical jungle.

The bigger of the two islands is home to the ruins of [Vos'Sykriss](ruins-of-vossykriss). An ancient city of a long vanished [Yuan-Ti](yuan-ti) civilization.
