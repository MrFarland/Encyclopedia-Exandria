### Emon Skyport
The Emon Skyport was the first skyport constructed specifically for the purpose of docking, loading, and unloading skyships. A sister skyport was constructed in [Ank'Harel](ankharel) and most of the trade and travel by skyship is between these two skyports.

While the skyports are technically municipal buildings, they are managed and maintained by the [Alsfarin Union](alsfarin-union). A secretive guild based in [Ank'Harel](ankharel) responsible for the development of airship technology and the operator of most current vessels.
