### Cobalt Vault
The Cobalt Vault is the oldest library in all of [Exandria](geography). It is managed by the [Cobalt Soul](cobalt-soul) and houses the largest collection of pre-calamity texts and scrolls in the entire world. It is located high on the side of the [Heaven's Stair](heavens-stair) in the Silver Talon's Reach district of [Vasselheim](vasselheim). It is rumoured that a great many dangerous Age of Arcanum texts are locked away in the vault's most secure levels.

In addition to being a library, the Cobalt Vault is also one of two main headquarters to the [Cobalt Soul](cobalt-soul). The High Curator of [Vasselheim](vasselheim), along with the High Curator of [Rexxentrum](rexxentrum) run the organization.
