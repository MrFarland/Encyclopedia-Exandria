### Raven's Crest
Located at the heart of the Dusk Meadow district in [Vasselheim](vasselheim) is the Raven's Crest. The largest and most impressive temple to the [Raven Queen](raven-queen) in all of [Exandria](geography). The temple is an ominious and imposing structure and completely unlike any of the other grand temples in the city. The entire structure is seemingly made of opaque black glass from the outside, but is actually translucent when looking out. Inside the main chamber of the temple the walls are dark gray and ivory. The air is very cold throughout the temple.

At the heart of the temple is the Communion Pool. A long stair climbs up to the top of a platform and ends at a dark oak door adorned with a dark iron ring in the center. Inside is a large pool of dark crimson liquid that is very cold and deep. The ceiling is vaulted over 100 feet and a stained glass dome that filters and colors the outside light as it enters the temple. The light is always shifting like a kaleidoscope.
