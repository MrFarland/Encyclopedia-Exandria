The Birthheart is a large temple to [Melora the Wild Mother](melora) in the Abundant Terrace district of [Vasselheim](vasselheim). It is a series of structures that wind around and climb the massive trunk of the [Seed of Rebirth](seed-of-rebirth). Terraced gardens are ring the outside of the temple grounds.

While the church of [Melora](melora) is not as centralized and organized as the churches of [Erathis](erathis), [Bahamut](bahamut-the-platinum-dragon), or [Pelor](pelor), the Birthheart is widely recognized as the spiritual and administrative heart of her followers. The Birthheart is led by the High Hierophant of the [Gladekeepers](gladekeepers).
