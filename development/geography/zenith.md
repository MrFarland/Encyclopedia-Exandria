### Zenith
The Zenith is a small temple to [Pelor the Dawn Father](pelor) in the Greyfields ward of [Whitestone](whitestone). The temple is made of stone and stained glass windows depict classic imagery of [Pelor](pelor). A large wooden wreath of fire is carved into the heavy wooden doors at the front of the temple.

Inside wooden pews line either side of the main aisle and three 10' wide stained glass windows line each side. A large stone altar stands on a small raised platform in the back. Doors lead to two small rooms on either side of the temple. One is the personal room of the head priest while the other is a <DM's Choice>. (Mine was a small library)

The Zenith has 1 [Priest](/monster/priest), 5 [Acolytes](/monster/acolyte) and a number of attendants and lay clergy that help out around the temple.
