### Palace of the Sovereign
The Palace of the Sovereign is a grand castle located at the highest point in the Cloudtop District of [Emon](emon). Prior to 815 PD, the palace was the royal residence of the [House of Tal'Dorei](house-of-taldorei) as well as the administrative heart of the Kingdom.

The Palace was heavily damaged during Thordak's occupation, but was rebuilt. Following its restoration, the Palace was turned into the permanent, administrative home of the [Council of Tal'Dorei](council-of-taldorei). The residential quarters are now reserved for visiting dignitaries and the grand ballrooms and dining areas for state functions.
