### Ziggurat of Whitestone
The corrupted Ziggurat of Whitestone was once the central temple to [Ioun the Knowing Mistress](ioun-the-knowing-mistress). It was once the site of a terrible battle between [Tharizdun](tharizdun-the-chained-oblivion) and [Ioun](ioun-the-knowing-mistress). She was nearly destroyed in the fight and the temple sank beneath the ground. 

The ziggurat was excavated and corrupted by the Briarwoods and nothing of [Ioun](ioun-the-knowing-mistress) now remains.
