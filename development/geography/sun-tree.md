### Sun Tree
The Sun Tree is a massive oak tree located in the heart of Dawnfather Square in the city of [Whitestone](whitestone). It is a couple of stories tall and its leaves are vibrant orange, red, and yellow year round. The tree is a major landmark in the city and an integral part of the city's identity and soul. 

The Sun Tree was planted by [Pelor](pelor) himself following the [Calamity](history) and it is over 800 years old. It was placed by the [Dawn Father](pelor) to mark the spot where [Tharizdun](tharizdun-the-chained-oblivion) nearly killed the [Knowing Mistress, Ioun](ioun-the-knowing-mistress). It is located directly above an ancient temple to [Ioun](ioun-the-knowing-mistress) that was corrupted during the Briarwood occupation.
