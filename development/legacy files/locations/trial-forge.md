### Trial Forge
The Trial Forge is a massive temple to [Kord the Storm Lord](kord) in the Braving Grounds of [Vasselheim](vasselheim). Long stairs lead to two heavy, rusty iron doors. Atop the temple is a gargantuan statue of Kord. He's shown as a large, muscular man with a long beard, bracers and one knee razed.

The interior of the temple is open and expansive. Two long, wide hallways intersect and create a central chamber with a raised platform in the center. Where each end of the hall meets the central chamber, large 100' tall archs of reddish stone hold the ceilings aloft. The floor is black marble with gold streaks.

The temple is used primarily for meditation, training, and sparring.
