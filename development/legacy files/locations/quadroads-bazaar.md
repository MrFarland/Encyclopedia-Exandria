### Quadroads Bazaar
The largest open-air market in [Vasselheim](vasselheim), the Quadroads Bazaar has a little of everything. While not as cosmopolitan as Abdar's Promenade in [Emon](emon) or exotic as the Suncut Bazaar in [Ank'Harel](ankharel), if it can be purchased anywhere on the continent, the Quadroads Bazaar likely has it.
