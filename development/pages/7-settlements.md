Emberhold is a [duergar](duergar) fortress and surrounding settlement located deep beneath the [dwarven](dwarves) settlement of [Kraghammer](kraghammer) in the underdark of the [Cliffkeep Mountains](cliffkeep-mountains). It is the cultural and political heart of the [Murghol Dynasty](murghol-dynasty).

##### Architecture
The fortress and surrounding buildings are prime examples of [duergar](duergar) architecture. They are expertly crafted from stone, but not overly decorative. Function over form.

##### Defenses
The fortress of Emberhold is a large castle crafted from obsidian. A massive magma fall cascades down on the roof of the fortress and splits to either side of the castle forming a large moat of molten rock.

Bands of [duergar](duergar) with [basilisks](/monster/basilisk) patrol the surrounding cavern and deal with intruders.

A secret entrance to the castle is rumored to exist under one of the lava flows.

##### Demographics

##### Government
Emberhold is ruled by the [Murghol Dynasty](murghol-dynasty), a monarchy currently in turmoil with an adolescent heir and various nobles vying for power.

The government is tyranical and the dynasty rules with an iron fist. Even minor dissent and disobedience is viewed as high-treason and punished severely.

##### Law & Order
Law and order in traditional [duergar](duergar) society is very different than the surface dwelling civilizations. The laws are quite different and punishments are typically harsh and cruel.

##### Religion
The [duergar](duergar) are deeply devoted to the lesser deity [Laduguer the Exile](laduguer-the-exile) and he is the only god-like being openly worshipped in Emberhold.

##### Services
It is assumed there are artisans and merchants in the stronghold of Emberhold, but nobody really knows for sure.

##### Society
Emberhold and the entirety of the [Murghol Dynasty](murghol-dynasty) civilization is extremely xenophobic and openly hostile to outsiders. They do not entertain visitors and very few who wander into the Emberhold ever leave of their own accord.

A burning hatred for the dwarves of [Kraghammer](kraghammer) is systemic. The origin for this hatred has long been forgotten, but it is maintained out of habit and reinforced by the Emberhold's leaders.

##### Trade & Industry
As a xenophobic, insular society, the [duergar](duergar) of Emberhold are largely self-sufficient. They do not actively trade with other civilizations and limit their interactions with outsiders to raids for goods and slaves.

### Emerald Outpost

| Ruined               | -                        |
{.sidebar}

The Emerald Outpost is a fortress located in the northern [Daggerbay Mountains](daggerbay-mountains). The outpost was originally created to defend [Syngorn](syngorn) against the growing Drassig Empire, but it is now used primarily as a trading post between the [human](council-of-taldorei) and [elven](wardens-of-syngorn) states.

The administrative heart of the outpost is the old war room, known as the Emerald Chambers.

##### Architecture
While the elven architecture is less stark and martial than a comparable [human](humans) or [dwarven](dwarves) outpost might be, there is no doubt the facility was created for war. All of the structures are built with flowing grace and a style reminiscent of [Syngorn](Syngorn), but with greater emphasis on function and security.

##### Defenses
The Emerald Outpost is protected by large, expertly crafted stone walls, tall towers, and heavy, reinforced gates. The entire settlement is encircled and an inner wall protects the administrative and military center of the town.

Overall defense of the outpost falls to the [Verdant Guard](verdant-guard), but a small detatchment of soldiers from the [Army of Tal'Dorei](army-of-taldorei) are permanently assigned to the outpost.

##### Demographics

##### Government
While the Emerald Outpost is owned and maintained by the [Wardens of Syngorn](wardens-of-syngorn), command of the outpost is shared with the [Council of Tal'dorei](council-of-taldorei) as a show of collaboration and partnership. 

Day-to-day management of the outpost is handled by the respective captains of the [Verdant Guard](verdant-guard) and the [Army of Tal'Dorei](army-of-taldorei). The arrangement works, but petty rivalries and squabbles are not uncommon.

##### Law & Order
Random, violent crime is virtually unheard of inside the Outpost. Public drunkenness, the occassional bar fight, and black market trading are more common issues.

Military matters are mostly solved internally, while judicial matters involving civilians or between the two militaries are decided by the Captains.

##### Religion
Small shrines to many of the [Prime Deities](pantheon) can be found within the outpost, but the only full-time clergy serve [Corellon](corellon-the-arch-heart), [Bahamut](bahamut-the-platinum-dragon), and [Erathis](erathis).

The shrine to [Avandra](avandra) receives a great deal of visitors as she is favored by travelers, merchants, and the small [halfling](halflings) population that live there.

##### Services
The Emerald Outpost is roughly the size of a large village or small town, but it's role as a military outpost and major trade hub guarantees the avilability of certain services, typically not found in such a small settlement. Even rarer services can be found in the outpost if the right merchant happens to be passing through.

> ***Note:** Support value is the # of people needed to support a given service. This is just a helpful guide. There are always execptions. Also, a settlement too small for a dedicated service, does not mean that service is not available.*
<!-- {blockquote: .paper} -->

##### Society
While [elven](elves) and [human](humans) culture sometimes clash in other settlements, the soldiers of the [Verdant Guard](verdant-guard) and [Army of Tal'Dorei](army-of-taldorei) have much more in common than their civilian counterparts. In fact, the most common clashes are between the warrior culture of the soldiers and the "soft" civilians that pass through.

##### Trade & Industry
Nearly all trade between [Emon](emon) and [Syngorn](syngorn) passes through the Emerald Outpost. It is a bustling trade center where merchants from both cities can buy and sell goods from the other.

Despite its relatively small size, the Emerald Outpost typically has goods only found in settlements two to three times it's size.

{.sidebar}

The city of Emon is located on the western shore of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei), on the northern end of the [Bladeshimmer Shoreline](bladeshimmer-shoreline). The city is the largest on the continent and the heart of the [Tal'Dorei Republic](council-of-taldorei) both politically and culturally. 

The city is divided into ten districts.

**Abdar's Promenade**. Located on the eastern side of the city, Abdar's Promenade is the marketplace district where nearly anything can be purchased.
- [Anvilgate](anvilgate)
- [Gilmore's Glorious Goods](gilmores-glorious-goods)
- [Laughing Lamia Inn](laughing-lamia-inn)

**Cemetary District**. The cemetary district is home to the city's tombs, mausoleums, and graveyards. It is largely run and protected by the [Gravewatchers Guild](gravewatchers).
- [Tomb of the Last Sovereign](tomb-of-the-last-sovereign)
- [Undervaults](undervaults)

**Central District**. The largest of the districts, the Central is home to Emon's lower middle class. While not as economically depressed as the slums, the Central District is rife with crime.
- [Azalea Street Park](azalea-street-park)
- [Grotto](grotto)
- [Ozmit Waterways](ozmit-waterways)

**Cloudtop District**. The Cloudtop is the highest point in the city physically, economically, and politically. It is home to the palace, the skyport, and the wealthy elite that rule Emon and all of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei).
- [Citrine Garrison](citrine-garrison)
- [Emon Skyport](emon-skyport)
- [Ivory Tower](ivory-tower)
- [Palace of the Sovereign](palace-of-the-sovereign)
- [Thordak's Crater](thordaks-crater)

**Erudite Quarter**. Home to the prestigious [Alabaster Lyceum](alabaster-lyceum), the Erudite is home to educational institutions and the scholars that run them. It is patrolled by the [Arms of Emon](arms-of-emon) and the [Lyceum's](alabaster-lyceum) private guards.
- [Alabaster Lyceum](alabaster-lyceum)
- [Traverse Junction](alabaster-lyceum)

**Military District**. The Military District is devoted to the housing and training of Emon's and [Tal'Dorei's] protectors. The [Arms of Emon](arms-of-emon) and the [Army of Tal'Dorei](army-of-taldorei). It is also home to the city's prison.
- [Black Bastille](black-bastille)
- [House of Discipline](house-of-discipline)
- [Walls of Tribute](walls-of-tribute)

**Port of Emon**. The Port of Emon is a the lifeblood of the city and much of the continent. Fishing and trade are the dominant industries in the district and tension between them is commonplace. The district is largely controlled by the rival [Everline](everline) & [Onyx Banner](onyx-banner) guilds.

**Temple District**. While there are smaller temples and shrines scattered throughout the city, the Temple District is home to the grand cathedrals and temples to the various deities worshipped by the people.
- [Godsbrawl Ring](godsbrawl-ring)

**Upper Slums**. Located just outside the north gate, the Upper Slums are rife with crime and poverty. It is a dangerous place to be after dark and the [Clasp](clasp) has a firm grasp on the entire district.
- [Grotto](grotto)

**Lower Slums**. The Lower Slums of Emon are equally as poor as the Upper Slums, but with significantly less crime. The entire district is focused on farming and food production and less urban.

**Shoreline Farms**. Located along the [Ozmit Sea](ozmit-sea) to the nortwest of the city, the Shoreline Farms district is booming. Rare fruits and vegetables that only grow in the brackish water support the local economy.

**Surrounding Areas**. Villages radiate out from the city for quite some distance. Fishing villages can be found up and down the coast while farming and logging villages can be found a day or two's walk east of the city.
- [Greyskull Keep](greyskull-keep)

##### Architecture
The city of Emon is not easily defined by its architecture. Most of the old buildings have a distinctive [human](humans) style, but [dwarven](dwarves) and [elven](elves) architectural styles are also quite prevalent. The end result is a kind of fusion that is unique to Emon.

##### Defenses
The city of Emon is surrounded by a large semi-circular stone wall that runs from the northwestern corner of the city, around the eastern side of the city and ends on the south side of the city. Slightly smaller walls with gates separate the interior districts of the city.

The city is policed and defended by the highly trained [Arms of Emon](arms-of-emon). In addition to the "Arms", the elite [Citrine Garrison](citrine-garrison) guards the Cloudtop District while the [Gravewatchers](gravewatchers) and [Alabaster Lyceum's private security](alabaster-lyceum) keep an eye on the Cemetary and Erudite districts respectively.

##### Demographics

##### Government
While day-to-day administration of the city is left to a well-established bureacracy, overall governance of the city passes to the quasi-democratic oligarchy known as the [Council of Tal'Dorei](council-of-taldorei).

##### Law & Order
The [Arms of Emon](arms-of-emon) are responsible for policiing the city. Each district has its own combination barracks, courthouse, and jail. A local magistrate and a barracks captain that commands the [Arms](arms-of-emon) for the district.

Crime is rampant in some parts of the city, but very little happens in Emon without the [Clasp's](clasp) knowledge. They have a heavy presence in the Central District and both slums.

##### Religion
[Erathis](erathis) and [Bahamut](bahamut-the-platinum-dragon) are the dominant gods in Emon, but all of the [Prime Deities](pantheon) have a strong following. Given the sheer size of the city, it is not hard to believe a number of temples and shrines to the various [Betrayer Gods](betrayer-gods) can be found throughout the city.

Most of the main temples can be found in the Temple District, but smaller temples and shrines are scattered throughout the city.

##### Services
There are very few things in the world of [Exandria](geography) that cannot be bought in the city of Emon. Artisans, scholars, and merchants of all types can be found in nearly every corner of the city. Anything you can't find in the smaller, residential neighborhoods can usually be found in the merchant district of Abdar's Promenade.

##### Society
Once a bastion of [human](humans) civilization, Emon is now a much more diverse, metropolis. While the elite in the Cloudtop and Erudite view and promote the city as a shining example of civilized, culture society the city is not without its issues.

The divide between the classes is wide and there are still some within the city that harbor the old biases against non-human races once harbored under the Drassigs.

##### Trade & Industry
Emon's economy is largely based on trade and services. The city is a massive trade center with much of the continent's wealth passing through the Port of Emon.

While there is some heavy industry outside the city, raw materials like timber, stone, and metals are largely imported. The chief exports are food and finished goods.

{.sidebar}

Fort Daxio is a large fortress located at the northern end of the [Othendin Pass](othendin-pass). The fort was established shortly after the Scattered War to protect the settlements and mining operations in the area from giant clans.

The fortress is operated by the [Army of Tal'Dorei](army-of-taldorei) and houses four of the army's regiments. Each regiment consists of 1,100 soliders each and while two regiments are often deployed to other parts of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei) at any given time, the fort can support all 4,400 troops plus an additional 500 civilians.

**Interior**: Nearly all of the fort's amenties and living quarters are located inside the mountains.
- [Watchman's Rest](watchmans-rest) 

**Surrounding Area**: Not much is known about the area around the fort, but it is assumed there are small settlements, some mines, and farms struggling to grow crops in the hard, rocky soil.

##### Architecture
Fort Daxio is a military installation where the focus is on utility and function instead of beauty. Everything is crafted from stone and hardened. Even the interior of the fort is utilitarian and rather bland.

##### Defenses
Fort Daxio is a massive fortress built directly into the side of the mountains. It has high, thick stone walls and there is only one gate. Ballista and trebuchets are located on the walls.

Inside the walls, a large central keep juts out from the side of the mountain with much of its interior underground. A heavy gate is the only way in, but it is expected there are secret ways out of the citadel either up on to the ridge behind or further down the valley.

##### Demographics

##### Government
Fort Daxio is a military complex governed by the [Army of Tal'Dorei](army-of-taldorei). Overall command resides with the Warmaster of the [Council of Tal'Dorei](council-of-taldorei) during times of war and the Master of Defense during peace time.

##### Law & Order
Fort Daxio is located in a remote corner of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei) and home to thousands of soldiers. Violent crime is virtually non-existent, but drunken and disorderly conduct and the occassional scuffle between soldiers is not uncommon.

##### Religion
[Bahamut](bahamut) and [Erathis](erathis) are the dominant gods in the fortress, but [Kord](kord) is also quite popular among the soldiers. [Moradin](moradin) and [Corellon](corellon) are also present among the [dwarven](dwarves) and [elven](elves) soldiers.

Only [Bahamut](bahamut) and [Erathis](erathis) have full-time [priests](/monster/priest) and dedicated shrines in the fortress.

##### Services
Nearly all of the services at Fort Daxio are operated by the military for the military. While they will sell and do work for civilians, the needs of the army come first and some things are not available to outsiders.

> ***Note:** Support value is the # of people needed to support a given service. This is just a helpful guide. There are always execptions. Also, a settlement too small for a dedicated service, does not mean that service is not available.*
<!-- {blockquote: .paper} -->

##### Society
Military life permeates all aspects of life at Fort Daxio. Organization, efficiency, structure, and discipline are core values throughout the settlement. Everything has a purpose and everything has its place. There is very little room for luxury and frivolity.

This culture extends to the civilians living inside the fortress, as well as those in the surrounding communities. Many served in the [army](army-of-taldorei) themselves and the [Othendin Pass](othendin-pass) is a very dangerous place. 

##### Trade & Industry
Fort Daxio is largely self-sufficient in terms of basic raw materials and food. The farms, logging camps, and mines in the area are largely dedicated to supporting the garrison and its troops. Very little is left over to export. 

While the fort is capable of producing basic items, refined finished goods are imported from [Emon](emon) and [Kraghammer](kraghammer).

Despite the name, Jorenn Village is a small town located at the southern base of the [Umbra Hills](umbra-hills) at the northern end of the [Black Valley](black-valley). It is a remote, frontier town connected to the rest of the [Republic of Tal'Dorei](council-of-taldorei) by the [Black Valley Path](black-valley-path).

The town is not large enough for any distinguishable neighborhoods. Most locals either live "in town" or on one of the many surrounding farms, orchards, mining or logging camps.

##### Architecture
The buildings in Jorenn Village are largely made of stone quarried from the [Cliffkeep Mountains](cliffkeep-mountains) and lumber from bearby forests. The streets are dirt and often muddy, but wide to accomodate large carts hauling ore from nearby mines to the city of [Westruun](westruun) to the south.

##### Defenses
Jorenn Village has no static defenses. It is largely open and sprawls across the southern base of the [Umbra Hills](umbra-hills).

The town also lacks a regular guard force. It is too far north for the [Shields of the Plains](shields-of-the-plains) and is instead protected by an all-volunteer militia known as the [Shadewatch](shadewatch). While created out of good intentions, the [Shadewatch](shadewatch) is not much more than a gang masquerading as a town guard.

##### Demographics

##### Government
The town of Jorenn Village is governed by an elected town manager and they oversee day-to-day operation of the town. The position does not have a lot of authority and they often look to the Margrave of [Westruun](westruun) for help with larger matters.

While the town is part of the [Republic](council-of-taldorei), Jorenn Village is so far removed as to be nearly autonomous. It is a wild, frontier town that is just barely a rung above lawlessness.

##### Law & Order
Crime is a little on the high side in Jorenn Village, but not out of control. Random fights between rival miners, the occassional theft, and a myriad of other low-level crimes are common enough to keep people on their toes.

Unfortunately for the people of Jorenn Village, the town is rife with corruption. There is very little protection from the [Shadewatch](shadewatch) and people generally expect to have to fend for themselves. While, they are an all-volunteer organization, the [Shadewatch](shadewatch) has begun extorting local businesses to pay for their protection and is quickly starting to resemble a thieves' guild than a town gaurd..

##### Religion
As a small, frontier town there are no permanent temples to any of the gods, but there are small shrines to [Avandra](avandra), [Modradin](moradin), and [Pelor](pelor).

##### Services
The town of Jorenn Village is growing due to a recent boom in mining and it is slowly transitioning from small, rural village, to small boom town. Services related to the growing mining industry are the most prominent and as the number of travellers to this out-of-the-way town increase, so do services catering to those travellers.

<!-- {blockquote: .paper} -->

##### Society
The people of Jorenn Village are rough, rugged people accustomed to life on the edge of untamed wilderness. The people are largely self-sufficient and not used to relying on others to solve their problems.

##### Trade & Industry
While the mining industry is growing, Jorenn Village's principle export is the spice known as 'Shadegrass'. This spice only grows in the [Umbra Hills](umbra-hills) and has become very popular with chefs in the larger cities of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei).

Farming and orchards are also plentiful in the valley, but most of that food stays local, with excess exported to [Westruun](westruun).

The dwarven stronghold of [Krahammer](kraghammer) is a large dwarven city in the [Cliffkeep Mountains](cliffkeep-mountains) and the center of [dwarven](dwarves) culture on the continent of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei). 

**Top Slab**. The "Arch" as it is also known is a large ring with various residential neighborhoods shooting of in different directions. The "Otherwalk" is home to most of the non-dwarven population in Kraghammer. The Top Slab is also home to the city's main markets and shopping district.
- [Balgus Brewery](balgus-brewery)
- [Firebrook Inn](firebrook-inn)
- [Ironhearth Tavern](ironhearth-tavern)
- [Starshrine](starshrine)
- [Temple of the All Hammer](temple-of-the-all-hammer)
- [Value of Valor](value-of-valor)

**Center Slab**. The Center Slab is known as the "Heart" of Kraghammer and it is both the administrative and political center of the city. The [Pyrethrone](pyrethrone) and major [houses of kraghammer](houses-of-kraghammer) are located in the center of the slab with more affluent neighborhoods on the outside edges.
- [Bronzegrip Manor](house-bronzegrip)
- [Glorenthal Manor](glorenthal-manor)
- [Greyspine Manor](house-greyspine)
- [Pyrethrone](pyrethrone)
- [Thunderbrand Manor](house-thunderbrand)
- [Zuurthom Manor](house-zuurthom)

**Bottom Slab**. The "Pit" as it is called, is the industrial center of the city. Massive quarries, mines, blast furnaces, and smithies fill the bottom level with smoke and soot.
- [Bronzegrip Metalworks](bronzegrip-metalworks)
- [Cracksackle Headquarters](cracksackle-headquarters)
- [Glowgrove](glowgrove)
- [Hall of Burning Mushrooms](hall-of-burning-mushrooms)
- [Keenstone Quarry](keenstone-quarry)

**Toppers**. Toppers are the people that live outside the city in the surrounding countryside. They are the farmers that grow food for the city and the foresters that harvest the trees of the [Wildwood](wildwood). While the individual villages and hamlets have their own names, the people are collectively referred to as toppers.

##### Architecture
Kraghammer is a showpiece of mastercraft dwarven masonry and stonecraft. There is no inch of the city that is not carefully crafted for maximum beauty and utilty. Fond of geometric shapes and patterns, the architecture is very angular and precise.

Near the center of the city, many of the buildings have a free-standing appearance, while some are built into the massive columns that hold up the massive ceilings for each level. Many of these towers serving as multi-tenant apartment buildings for lower income members of Kraghammer society.

The overall layout of the city is designed around a central core on the three distinct levels. Each level radiates outward from the core with the most essential businesses and industries near the center and residential and non-essential structures. Large elevators provide easy transit between the levels.

##### Defenses
Kraghammer is a fortress. The entrance to the city is carved into the side of Mount Kraghammer and fronted by a massive chasm. A single stone bridge spans the chasm and it is wide enough for large wagons to cross single-file. Large, fortified towers guard the bridge, while even larger towers, set into the mountain face protect the massive adamantine gates.

Defense of the city falls to the [Carvers](carvers), a highly-trained guard and military.

##### Demographics

##### Government
Kraghammer is ruled by the five noble houses of Kraghammer known as the [Houses of Kraghammer](houses-of-kraghammer). They form a council and elect one of their own to serve as the Ironkeeper, an executive position tasked with day-to-day administration of the city.

##### Law & Order
Kraghammer has very little crime. The [Carvers](carvers) are seemingly everywhere and [dwarven](dwarves) society, at least in Kraghammer, is lawful and unlikely to cause trouble outside of the occassional fight or scuffle spilling out from a pub or tavern.

Penalties for crimes are more severe in than in places like [Emon](emon) or [Syngorn](syngorn), but nearly all sentences come with a fine that can help the perpetrator avoid jail time.

##### Religion
[Moradin](moradin) is the dominant religion in Kraghammer by a wide margin, but [Bahamut](bahamut) and [Kord](kord) are also popular.

Located on the Top Slab, the [Temple of the All Hammer](temple-of-the-all-hammer) is a large and beautiful temple to [Moradin](moradin) and is considered by most [dwarves](dwarves) to be the center of their faith.

While the [dwarves](dwarves) of Kraghammer are not intolerant of other faiths, they're not exactly welcoming either. There are no other permanent temples to the other [Prime Deities](prime-deities) and most followers of other faiths worship at the [Starshrine](starshrine) on the top slab.

##### Services
Kraghammer is heavily focused on crafting and heavy industry. Master craftsmen of all kinds can be found around nearly every corner of the city. The likely has many more skilled artisans, smiths, and masons than surface cities of a comparable size.

While there is no shortage of pubs and taverns, Kraghammer does not have as many visitors as other cities of its size. Inns for travelers and adventurers would be found on the Top Slab or in the surface settlements. Some hostels or boarding houses might be found on the bottom slab to provide temporary housing for new workers. Likewise, any stables or liveries would likely be found just inside the main gate or above ground.

Canonically, Kraghammer does not have much in the way of magic shops, magical supply stores, or general enchanters. It is largely controlled by [House Thunderbrand](house-thunderbrand) as the [dwarves](dwarves) of Kraghammer are generally not big practicioners of the arcane arts.

<!-- {blockquote: .paper} -->

##### Society
Kraghammer is a relatively isolated and insular society and a little xenophobic. The [dwarves](dwarves) of Kraghammer are distrustful of outsiders in general and certain races, especially. There is a lot of bad blood between the [dwarves](dwarves) of Kraghammer and the [elves](elves) of [Syngorn](syngorn) and while relations between the two have improved, long-lived races do not forgive and forget easily. 

Despite their hang-ups and biases, the [dwarves](dwarves) of Kraghammer pride themselves on being good hosts. The [Carvers](carvers) may keep a close eye on the strange visitors, but the rest are happy to share a meal and a pint with their guests.

##### Trade & Industry
While Kraghammer is socially and culturally insular, the city does an enormous amoung of trade with the [Republic of Tal'Dorei](council-of-taldorei) among others. Raw materials such as metals, gems, and stone are exported in great quantities, but it is their finished goods that are in high demand. The dwarves are known for their masterfully crafted armor, weapons, jewelry, and other goods.

The elven city of Lyrengorn is an indepedent city-state located between the [Elvenpeaks](elvenpeaks) in the northern range of the [Cliffkeep Mountain Range](cliffkeep-mountain-range) on the southern edge of the [Neverfields](neverfields).

##### Architecture
The architecture of Lyrengorn is undeniably elven in nature, but is unique and less formal than can be found in cities like [Syngorn](syngorn). 

##### Defenses
Lyrengorn is a city that does not have much in the way of structured defenses or standing military. It relies on its location, the shelter of the [Elvenpeaks](elvenpeaks) and its strident neutrality to keep it safe.

##### Demographics

##### Government
Lyrengorn manages to walk a fine line between freedom and anarchy. The city is governed by a small council, but the body is largely ceremonial. They rule with an extremely light-touch and the people of Lyrengorn are given incredible freedom to live their lives peacefully.

##### Religion
The dominant religion of Lyrengorn is [Sehanine the Moon Weaver](sehanine). While [Corellon](corellon) does have a following in the city, he is not nearly as revered as in other elven settlements.

##### Services
Lyrengorn is not a large city and does not receive a lot of visitors. The local economy is largely self-sufficient with only a fraction supporting the export/import of goods.

The city of O'Noa was the first permanent, [human](humans) settlement on the continent of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei) following the Calamity. Over time it would become an important port in a burgeoning [human](humans) empire that included much of the [Bladeshimmer Shoreline](bladeshimmer-shoreline). After the Scattered War, the city of O'Noa was destroyed and abandoned. [Emon](emon) had long supplanted it as the dominant city on the coast and O'Noa fell to ruin.

A few centuries later, people started to move into the ruins. The settlement called "New O'Noa" quickly became a haven for criminals and outcasts. They live on the fringes of civilization, outside the laws of the [Council of Tal'Dorei](council-of-taldorei). To the untrained eye, the city is still an abandoned ruin. The denizens of New O'Noa have become quite adept at remaining unseen and operating in the shadows.

While New O'Noa is relatively small and fits within roughly 1 square mile, the ruins are much larger.

##### Architecture
Much of O'Noa's original architecture has crumbled and fallen away. The current settlement looks more like a shanty town with haphazard construction using scrap materials scavenged from the ruins.

##### Defenses
There is no organized defenses for the new settlement within the ruins. The original walls and towers have collapsed and they offer no real protection. 

Instead of traditional defenses, O'Noa relies on well-hidden watchers to alert the others of intruders poking around where they don't belong.

##### Demographics

##### Government
O'Noa is ruled by whomever among them has the charisma, will, and ruthlessness to call the shots. 

##### Law & Order
The law is determined by whomever is currently in charge. Vigilante justice is common and crime rampant.

The [Clasp](clasp) has limited influence in O'Noa. The people of O'Noa are not keen on anyone telling them what to do and that includes organized thieves' guilds as well as governments.

##### Religion
Religion is not a big part of society in O'Noa. While some may offer prayers to [Avandra](avandra), [Kord](kord), or [Sehanine](sehanine-the-moon-weaver) many in O'Noa have more in common with the [Betrayers](betrayer-gods): [Asmodeus](asmodeus-the-lord-of-the-hells), [Gruumsh](gruumsh-the-ruiner), and [Tharizdun](tharizdun-the-chained-oblivion).

##### Services
There are no shops or full-time merchants in the ruins of O'noa. 

##### Society
Life in O'Noa is harsh and unforgiving. Survival of the fittest is the golden rule and the people are incredibly self-sufficient and tough.

##### Trade & Industry
O'Noa's principle trade is crime. Bandits raid trade caravans on the [Emerald Path](emerald-path), while the few pirates that call O'Noa home raid the shipping lanes between [Tal'Dorei](taldorei) and [Marquet](marquet).

The Shalesteps is not a single settlement, but a number of allied villages scattered throughout the southern [Seashale Mountains](seashale-mountains) northwest of [Emon](emon).

**Puddlefoot**. Puddlefoot is a small fishing village located at the base of the [Seashales](seashales) on the southern side of the [Nightwash](nightwash-tide). It is mostly [human](humans) and [halfling](halflings) with a few [dwarves](dwarves). It is the largest of the allied villages and the closest to [Emon](emon).

> ***Note:** There are no other individual villages named in official sources. It is implied there are three, but there could easily be more.*
<!-- {blockquote: .paper} -->

##### Architecture
Architecture varies from village to village and is largely based on the location, focus, and dominant race in that village. 
- The mostly [human](humans) fishing villages along the [Nightwash](nightwash) are simple wooden shacks and huts built on stilts. 
- The villages more inland and focused on farming favor more traditional [halfling](halflings) style cottages and burrows.
- The mountain villages focused on mining and hunting are built into the mountainside and reminiscent of dwarven settlements in the [Cliffkeeps](cliffkeep-mountains).

##### Defenses
None of the villages are fortified, but all employ some form of volunteer watch and alarm. Similarly, all of the villages aid in each other's defense.

##### Demographics

##### Government
Each village is led by an elected "Elder" who then represents that village in a grand council of all the villages.

##### Law & Order
Crime, outside of the occassional fight or public drunkenness, is unheard of in the Shalesteps. Criminal and civil disputes are decided by jury trial, presided over by the village "Elder".

##### Religion
The most commonly followed gods in the Shalesteps are [Melora](melora), [Avandra](avandra), [Kord](kord) and [Pelor](pelor). There may be 1 or 2 [acolytes](/monster/acolyte) among the villages of the Shalesteps, but there are no dedicated temples or clergy.

##### Services
There are very few shops in the villages of the Shalesteps. A small general store and blacksmith in Puddlefoot service all of the other villages. Likewise, there are no inns or taverns. 

##### Society
The Shalesteps are a very tight-knit community. The individual villages may only have a handful of families in each one and marriages often involve couples from different villages. Nearly everyone you meet has a cousin or sibling in another village.

The people of the Shalesteps are wary of outsiders, but are friendly and welcoming.

##### Trade & Industry
While the individual villages are quite small and rural, the Shalesteps do a great deal of business with nearby [Emon](emon). They provide the city with a great deal of seafood, produce, stone, and wild game.

Locally, the Shalesteps has little to offer in terms of goods and services.

The village of Terrah is located in the wide, bowl-like valley in the center of the sprawling [Cliffkeep Mountains](cliffkeep-mountain-range). The village is home to the druids of the [Earth Ashari](ashari), who guard the rift between the material plane of [Exandria](geography) and the Elemental Plan of Earth nearby.

##### Architecture
Despite being a small village, the architecture of Terrah consists of expertly crafted stone and and earth. Many of the [Earth Ashari](ashari) are expert masons and possess the ability to meld stone like clay. The result is highly refined, scultped structures that show no signs of chisel work.

##### Defenses
Terrah has no permanent defenses in the form of walls or fortifactions and no standing guard or militia. 

##### Demographics

##### Government
The village is governed by a leader called the "Heart of the Mountain". Selected by their predecessor, they must first pass a series of trials, known as an Aramente, to prove their worth.

##### Law & Order
Crime is virtually non-existent in Terrah. What squabbles or disagreements that arise are quickly settled by the "Heart of the Mountain".

##### Religion
The [Ashari](ashari) are not particularly religious, but there are many that worship [Melora](melora) and [Moradin](moradin) in Terrah.


##### Services
Services are extremely limited in Terrah. There is no need for inns, taverns, or most forms of shops and while there are a number of skilled artisans in Terrah, these are just one of many roles they provide to the community.

##### Society
See the faction page for the [Ashari](ashari)

##### Trade & Industry
Terrah's economy is completely self-sufficient and focused on their own needs. Trade with the [dwarves](dwarves) of [Kraghammer](kraghammer) is rare, but not unheard of.

The city of Whitestone is located in the far northeastern corner of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei) at the northern end of the [Alabaster Peninsula](alabaster-sierras). The city lies at the base of the [Alabaster Sierras](alabaster-sierra-range) where the mountains wrap around the northern tip of the peninsula. The massive [Parchwood Timberland](parchwood-timberland) completely surrounds the city and a single road called the [Alabaster Trail](alabaster-trail) leads south to [Turst Fields](turst-fields) and the rest of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei).

**Castle Ward**. The Castle Ward is home to [Castle Whitestone](castle-whitestone) and its grounds. It is on the north end of the city and up on a hill that overlooks the entire city.
- [Castle Whitestone](castle-whitestone)
- [Whitestone Riflemen Barracks](whitestone-riflemen)

**Common Ward**. The Common Ward is a working class neighborhood on the southern side of the city. It is just inside the main gate off the [Alabaster Trail](alabaster-trail).
- [Estate of the Mistress of the Grey Hunt](grey-hunt)
- [Lady's Chamber](ladys-chamber)

**Dawnfather Square**. The heart of the city, Dawnfather Square is a large square filled with shops, market stalls, and inns. At the center of the Square stands the massive [Sun Tree](sun-tree).
- [Sun Tree](sun-tree)
- [Ziggurat of Whitestone](ziggurat-of-whitestone)

**Greyfields**. The Greyfields is the cemetary and temple district of the city and houses temples to [Pelor](pelor) and the [Raven Queen](raven-queen).
- [Altar of the Raven](altar-of-the-raven)
- [Zenith](zenith)

**Northern Ward**. The Northern Ward is the more affluent part of the city and sits between Dawnfather Square and the Castle Ward.
- [Paleguard Barracks](paleguard-barracks)

**Surrounding Area**. The city of Whitestone is surrounded by the [Parchwood Timberland](parchwood-timberland) and living outside the city is dangerous. Still, small farming communities, lumber and mining camps dot the landscape.

##### Architecture
Buildings in Whitestone are mostly built from expertly cut stone and lumber. The architectural style is reminiscent of buildings from the [de Rolo's](house-of-de-rolo) native [Wildemount](wildemount).

##### Defenses
Whitestone has a large, stone wall that completely encompasses the entire city. A number of gates allow local citizens to pass in and out of the city and each gate is well-guarded by the city's [Paleguard](paleguard).

On a hill overlooking the city is a large keep called [Castle Whitestone](castle-whitestone). the keep is home to the [de Rolo family](house-of-de-rolo) and [Chamber of Whitestone](chamber-of-whitestone). It is defended by an elite, firearm equipped unit called the [Whitestone Riflemen](whitestone-riflemen).

While the nearby villages are patrolled by the [Paleguard](paleguard), the [Grey Hunt](grey-hunt) protect the city by hunting monstrosities and beasts in the surrounding [Parchwood Timberland](parchwood-timberland) and [Alabaster Sierra Range](alabaster-sierra-range).

In addition to the traditional defenses, the city of Whitestone is protected by an Illusory Barrier that was built during in 815 PD. The barrier is a collection of obelisks made of whitestone and positioned around the city. When activated, they form an illusory dome of unspoiled wilderness over the entire city.

The barrier is powered by the expenditure of spell slots. All five obelisks must be active at the same time for the barrier to work.
- 2 Hours = 1 spell level x 5

##### Demographics

##### Government
The city of Whitestone is governed by the [Chamber of Whitestone](chamber-of-whitestone), a council led by the [de Rolo family](house-of-de-rolo) and includes leaders from the community.

##### Law & Order
Crime is low in Whitestone. The [Clasp](clasp) and [Myriad](myriad) maintain some presence in the city, but not nearly to the extent in the other cities of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei). 

##### Religion
The dominant religion in Whitestone is that of [Pelor](pelor). The [de Rolos](house-de-rolo) are ardent supporters of the Dawn Father and their faith played a pivotal role in the city's founding.

The [Sun Tree](sun-tree) in Dawnfather Square is a constant reminder of the city's devotion to [Pelor](pelor) as is the [Zenith](zenith) in the Greyfields.

While not as prevalent as [Pelor](pelor), [Erathis the Law Bearer](erathis) also has a strong presence in the city. The [Lady's Chamber](ladys-chamber) is located in the southwestern corner of the city in the Common Ward.

Worship of the [Raven Queen](raven-queen) became more common in 815 PD when the [Altar of the Raven](altar-of-the-raven) was constructed behind the [Temple of the Dawn](temple-of-the-dawn) in the Greyfields.

##### Services
Despite being a relatively small city, Whitestone's remote location and history of isolationism have made the city more self-sufficient than other cities of its size might be. As a result, it has a little more to offer in the way of professional services.

<!-- {blockquote: .paper} -->

##### Society
The people of Whitestone are tough folk. The city was founded by the [de Rolo family](house-of-de-rolo) in the early 600s and a frontier spirit has become central to their ethos. That combined with years of occupation under the Briarwoods in the early 800s has created a culture that prides itself on self-reliance and perserverance.

##### Trade & Industry
The chief export of the city is a chalk-white rock called 'whitestone' that is infused with magical properties. The material can be refined into a green glass-like substance called residuum that increases its potency. It has a number of uses to arcane spellcasters and is highly desired by mages throughout [Exandria](geography). The material can be refined into a green glass-like substance called residuum that increases its potency.
