# History
[Exandria](geography) has a rich, complex history that is constantly evolving as scholars from the various centers of arcane learning delve into ancient ruins to uncover long-lost clues about the history of [Exandria](geography) and it's [people](races).

While there is much we do not know about the origins of [Exandria](geography) and the events leading up to present day, it is widely accepted that [Exandria](geography) has passed through three tumultuos ages called the [Founding](founding), the [Age of Arcanum](age-of-arcanum), and the [Calamity](calamity) before entering the fourth and current age known as [Post Divergence](post-divergence).

## Founding
The exact origins of [Exandria](geography) remain a mystery, but it is believed the world was discovered by the [Gods](pantheon) thousands of years ago. Enamored with [Exandria](geography) they began to shape and mold the world and give it life.

##### The First Children
When their work with the land was nearly complete, they created a wide array of creatures in their own image to inhabit their new creation. These would be called the [First Children](races) and included the races of the [elves](elves), [dwarves](dwarves), [humans](humans), [halflings](halflings), [gnomes](gnomes), and [tieflings](tieflings).

The world of [Exandria](geography), despite the [God's](pantheon) best efforts, was still a dangerous land. The elements raged uncontrollably and many of their creations were lost. To help protect them, the [Gods](pantheon) created the first of the metallic dragons. Under the guidance and protection of these dragon, the people prospered and civilization began to flourish.

##### Rise of the Primordials
Unbeknonst to the [Gods](gods), [Exandria](geography), was not devoid of life when they began their work. Great [primordial](primordials) titans lay dormant throughout the world. Awakened by the work of the [Gods](pantheon), the titans rose from their slumber and wrecked havoc on the world and it's newest [inhabitants](races).

Newly formed civilizations were destroyed in the chaos. Powerful wind storms, devasting earthquakes, fires, and tidal waves raged across [Exandria](geography). The [Gods](pantheon) were dismayed by the destruction and rift began to develop between them.

##### Splitting the Pantheon
Many of the [Gods](pantheon) were unwilling to concede defeat. These [Prime Deities](prime-deities) were determined to restore some semblance of order to the world they worked so hard to create.

The others were divided. Some sought to control the chaos and bend it to their will, while others succumbed to madness and joined with the titans.
