### Flamereach Outpost
The Flamereach Outpost is a small, stone foretress hastily constructed on the edge of the [Flamereach Grove](flamereach-grove) and [Snowember Fields](snowember-fields) in an area known as the "Scar of the Cinder King" (815 PD).

The outpost houses anywhere from 10-20 people at a time and it is led by a druid of the [Fire Ashari](ashari) from the village of [Pyrah](pyrah). The team at the outpost is tasked with keeping a close eye on the Scar and coming up with some way to heal the land.
