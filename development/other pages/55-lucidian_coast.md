### Drynna
### Dunghill
### Knifemouth River
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Lucidian^ ^Coast^](lucidian-coast)

**^Type:^** ^Swamp^

The Knifemouth is one of many rivers that flow through the [K'Tawl Swamp](ktawl-swamp) on the [Lucidian Coast](lucidian-coast) of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei). It begins on the eastern slope of the [Summit Peaks](summit-peaks) and winds its way through the [K'Tawl](ktawl-swamp) before emptying into the [Lucidian](lucidian-ocean) in the [K'Tawl Bay](ktawl-bay) about 100 miles north of [Stilben](stilben).

> There are many rivers in the [K'Tawl](ktawl-swamp) and most are not named in any of our sources. The many [Lizardfolk](lizardfolk), [Grung](grung), and [Orcs](orcs) that live within the swamp have their own names for them and I've done my best to learn those names and document them for this Encyclopedia.

### K'Tawl Bay
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Lucidian^ ^Coast^](lucidian-coast)

**^Type:^** ^Coastal^ ^&^ ^Swamp^

The K'Tawl Bay is a large bay on the [Lucidian Coast](lucidian-coast) of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei). The bay stretches up the coast a little over 140 miles from [Stilben](stilben) to the mouth of the [Lower Mooren River Run](lower-mooren-river-run).

The bay does not provide much in the way of protection from the open ocean, but the mangroves and inlets along the coast provide plenty of hiding places for pirates and smugglers.

### K'Tawl Creek
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Lucidian^ ^Coast^](lucidian-coast)

**^Type:^** ^Swamp^

The K'Tawl Creek is a long, slow moving river that decends from the [Summit Peaks](summit-peaks) and into the southern portion of the [K'Tawl Swamp](ktawl-swamp) in eastern [Tal'Dorei](taldorei). It winds through the [K'Tawl](ktawl-swamp) for a little over a hundred miles before it reaches the [Lucidian Ocean](lucidian-ocean) at the city of [Stilben](stilben).

The K'Tawl is navigable, but it's winding route and the swamp's dangerous denizens make it impractical for travel. The [Silvercut Roadway](silvercut-roadway) follows the river for a bit, but is straighter and drier.

> There are a lot of rivers in the [K'Tawl](ktawl-swamp) and most of them are not named in any of our sources. The many [Lizardfolk](lizardfolk), [Grung](grung), and [Orcs](orcs) tribes that live within the swamp have their own names for them and I've done my best to learn those names and document them for this Encyclopedia.

### K'Tawl Swamp
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Lucidian^ ^Coast^](lucidian-coast)

**^Type:^** ^Swamp^

The K'Tawl Swamp is a large bayou-like swamp that stretches 200 miles along the central portion of [Tal'Dorei's](taldorei) [Lucidian Coast](lucidian-coast). Large cypress and tupelo trees dominate the swamp and moss hangs from many of their branches. The swamp begins on the north side of the [Owlset Bay](owlset-bay), surrounds the port city of [Stilben](stilben) and ends before the mouth of the [Lower Mooren River Run](lower-mooren-river-run). 

Runoff from the [Summit Peaks](summit-peaks) to the west feeds the swamp through a number of rivers and streams including the [K'Tawl Creek](ktawl-creek) and [Knifemouth River](knifemouth-river). All of the swamp's creeks and rivers eventually find their way to the [K'Tawl Bay](ktawl-bay) and [Lucidian Ocean](lucidian-ocean) to the east.

The K'Tawl is an extremely dangerous place teeming with dangerous creatures and tribes of [orcs](orcs), [lizardfolk](lizardfolk), [bullywugs](/monster/bullywug), [grung](/monster/grung), and [sahuagin](/monster/sahuagin). Most of the tribes are content to live in peace, but they tend to be fiercely territorial and do not tolerate trespassers.

### Lower Mooren River Run
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Lucidian^ ^Coast^](lucidian-coast)

**^Type:^** ^Coastal^

Unlike the [upper](upper-mooren-river-run), the lower Mooren River Run is a wide, deep, slow moving channel that connects the [Mooren Lake](mooren-lake) and the lakeside town of [Drynna](drynna) in eastern [Tal'Dorei](taldorei) to the [Lucidian Ocean](lucidian-ocean). It provides a second, albeit smaller, port for the [Republic of Tal'Dorei](council-of-taldorei) on the [Lucidian Coast](lucidian-coast) and it is an important trade route with the [Menagerie Coast](menagerie-coast) on the continent of [Wildemount](wildemount).

The lower Mooren River Run is a little over 100 miles long and is deep and wide enough for keelboats and schooners to navigate upriver to the [Mooren Lake](mooren-lake). The shore on either side of the river is coastal plain, with the easter bank a little wetter as it slowly transitions to the [Rootgarden Marsh](rootgarden-marsh) on the eastern side of the lake.

Trips up and down the lower Mooren are slow going and typically require extra security to keep pirates and opportunistic [gnolls](/monster/gnolls) or [lizardfolk](lizardfolk) from raiding the ships as they make the trip upriver.

> While technically the same river, the portions of the Mooren River Run above and below [Mooren Lake](mooren-lake) could not be more different. As such, I have created separate entries for the [Upper Mooren River Run](upper-mooren-river-run) and the [Lower Mooren River Run](lower-mooren-river-run).

### Mooren Lake
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Lucidian^ ^Coast^](lucidian-coast)

**^Type:^** ^Coastal^

Mooren Lake is a large, crystal-clear lake located on the [Lucidian Coast](lucidian-coast) of eastern [Tal'Dorei](taldorei). It is important source of fresh fish for much of eastern [Tal'Dorei](taldorei) and connects the lake town of [Drynna](drynna) to the [Lucidian Ocean](lucidian-ocean) via the [lower Mooren River Run](lower-mooren-river-run).

On the western banks of the lake are the rich farmlands of the eastern [Dividing Plains](dividing-plains) while the [Rootgarden Marsh](rootgarden-marsh) domintaes the entirety of the lake's eastern shore. In the center of the lake, two islands lay perpetually shrouded in mist. Rumors tell of an ageless woman known as the [Moon Mistress](moon-mistress) residing on the larger of the two.

Beneath the crystal clear surface, lies centuries of magically-infused [whitestone](/item/whitestone) that has washed down the [upper Mooren River Run](upper-mooren-river-run) from the [Alabaster Sierras](alabaster-sierra-range) far to the north. Rumors tell of strange things happening to the lake bed as a result.

### Owlset Bay
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Lucidian^ ^Coast^](lucidian-coast)

**^Type:^** ^Coastal^

Owlset Bay is a small bay off of the [Lucidian Ocean](lucidian-ocean) in eastern [Tal'Dorei](taldorei). It is located southwest of [Stilben](stilben) and northeast of the [Stormcrest Mountains](stormcrest-mountains). The [Foramere Waterway](foramere-waterway) empties into the bay on the western side.

### Rootgarden Marsh
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Lucidian^ ^Coast^](lucidian-coast)

**^Type:^** ^Swamp^

Rootgarden Marsh is a large marshland east of [Mooren Lake](mooren-lake). The marsh is a mixture of soggy earth, groves of trees, and brackish pools. The boundaries between the marsh and the [lake](mooren-lake) to the west and [Lucidian Ocean](lucidian-ocean) are not easily defined. Both seem to simply vanish into the Rootgarden gradually.

The Rootgarden Marsh is home to a number of humanoid tribes, but most keep to themselves and do not trouble the settlement of [Drynna](drynna) on the western bank of the [Mooren Lake](mooren-lake). The [Moonsteeth Gnolls](moonsteeth-gnolls) are the most aggressive and regularly venture out to raid the neighboring farms and villages.

In addition to the normal creatures found in a swamp, the Rootgarden is home to Manawort, a sentient fungus used in some powerful potions.

### Stilben


### Summit Peaks
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Lucidian^ ^Coast^](lucidian-coast)

**^Type:^** ^Mountain^

The Summit Peaks is a small mountain range located in eastern [Tal'Dorei](taldorei) on the western edge of the [K'Tawl Swamp](ktawl-swamp) and located northeast of [Stilben](stilben).  

While the range is much smaller than the [Cliffkeeps](cliffkeep-mountain-range), [Stormcrests](stormcrest-mountains), or [Alabaster Sierras](alabaster-sierra-range), the Summit Peaks are very tall and steep. Compared to the lowlands of the [Dividing Plains](dividing-plains) and [Lucidian Coast](lucidian-coast), the mountains seem even taller.

High in the Summit Peaks, lies the rift to the [Elemental Plane of Air](elemental-plane-of-air) and the [Ashari](ashari) village of [Zephrah](zephrah).
