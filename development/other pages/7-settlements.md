The elven city of Lyrengorn is an indepedent city-state located between the [Elvenpeaks](elvenpeaks) in the northern range of the [Cliffkeep Mountain Range](cliffkeep-mountain-range) on the southern edge of the [Neverfields](neverfields).

##### Architecture
The architecture of Lyrengorn is undeniably elven in nature, but is unique and less formal than can be found in cities like [Syngorn](syngorn). 

##### Defenses
Lyrengorn is a city that does not have much in the way of structured defenses or standing military. It relies on its location, the shelter of the [Elvenpeaks](elvenpeaks) and its strident neutrality to keep it safe.

##### Demographics

##### Government
Lyrengorn manages to walk a fine line between freedom and anarchy. The city is governed by a small council, but the body is largely ceremonial. They rule with an extremely light-touch and the people of Lyrengorn are given incredible freedom to live their lives peacefully.

##### Religion
The dominant religion of Lyrengorn is [Sehanine the Moon Weaver](sehanine). While [Corellon](corellon) does have a following in the city, he is not nearly as revered as in other elven settlements.

##### Services
Lyrengorn is not a large city and does not receive a lot of visitors. The local economy is largely self-sufficient with only a fraction supporting the export/import of goods.

The city of O'Noa was the first permanent, [human](humans) settlement on the continent of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei) following the Calamity. Over time it would become an important port in a burgeoning [human](humans) empire that included much of the [Bladeshimmer Shoreline](bladeshimmer-shoreline). After the Scattered War, the city of O'Noa was destroyed and abandoned. [Emon](emon) had long supplanted it as the dominant city on the coast and O'Noa fell to ruin.

A few centuries later, people started to move into the ruins. The settlement called "New O'Noa" quickly became a haven for criminals and outcasts. They live on the fringes of civilization, outside the laws of the [Council of Tal'Dorei](council-of-taldorei). To the untrained eye, the city is still an abandoned ruin. The denizens of New O'Noa have become quite adept at remaining unseen and operating in the shadows.

While New O'Noa is relatively small and fits within roughly 1 square mile, the ruins are much larger.

##### Architecture
Much of O'Noa's original architecture has crumbled and fallen away. The current settlement looks more like a shanty town with haphazard construction using scrap materials scavenged from the ruins.

##### Defenses
There is no organized defenses for the new settlement within the ruins. The original walls and towers have collapsed and they offer no real protection. 

Instead of traditional defenses, O'Noa relies on well-hidden watchers to alert the others of intruders poking around where they don't belong.

##### Demographics

##### Government
O'Noa is ruled by whomever among them has the charisma, will, and ruthlessness to call the shots. 

##### Law & Order
The law is determined by whomever is currently in charge. Vigilante justice is common and crime rampant.

The [Clasp](clasp) has limited influence in O'Noa. The people of O'Noa are not keen on anyone telling them what to do and that includes organized thieves' guilds as well as governments.

##### Religion
Religion is not a big part of society in O'Noa. While some may offer prayers to [Avandra](avandra), [Kord](kord), or [Sehanine](sehanine-the-moon-weaver) many in O'Noa have more in common with the [Betrayers](betrayer-gods): [Asmodeus](asmodeus-the-lord-of-the-hells), [Gruumsh](gruumsh-the-ruiner), and [Tharizdun](tharizdun-the-chained-oblivion).

##### Services
There are no shops or full-time merchants in the ruins of O'noa. 

##### Society
Life in O'Noa is harsh and unforgiving. Survival of the fittest is the golden rule and the people are incredibly self-sufficient and tough.

##### Trade & Industry
O'Noa's principle trade is crime. Bandits raid trade caravans on the [Emerald Path](emerald-path), while the few pirates that call O'Noa home raid the shipping lanes between [Tal'Dorei](taldorei) and [Marquet](marquet).

The village of Terrah is located in the wide, bowl-like valley in the center of the sprawling [Cliffkeep Mountains](cliffkeep-mountain-range). The village is home to the druids of the [Earth Ashari](ashari), who guard the rift between the material plane of [Exandria](geography) and the Elemental Plan of Earth nearby.

##### Architecture
Despite being a small village, the architecture of Terrah consists of expertly crafted stone and and earth. Many of the [Earth Ashari](ashari) are expert masons and possess the ability to meld stone like clay. The result is highly refined, scultped structures that show no signs of chisel work.

##### Defenses
Terrah has no permanent defenses in the form of walls or fortifactions and no standing guard or militia. 

##### Demographics

##### Government
The village is governed by a leader called the "Heart of the Mountain". Selected by their predecessor, they must first pass a series of trials, known as an Aramente, to prove their worth.

##### Law & Order
Crime is virtually non-existent in Terrah. What squabbles or disagreements that arise are quickly settled by the "Heart of the Mountain".

##### Religion
The [Ashari](ashari) are not particularly religious, but there are many that worship [Melora](melora) and [Moradin](moradin) in Terrah.


##### Services
Services are extremely limited in Terrah. There is no need for inns, taverns, or most forms of shops and while there are a number of skilled artisans in Terrah, these are just one of many roles they provide to the community.

<!-- {blockquote: .paper} -->

##### Society
See the faction page for the [Ashari](ashari)

##### Trade & Industry
Terrah's economy is completely self-sufficient and focused on their own needs. Trade with the [dwarves](dwarves) of [Kraghammer](kraghammer) is rare, but not unheard of.

{.sidebar}

The city of Whitestone is located in the far northeastern corner of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei) at the northern end of the [Alabaster Peninsula](alabaster-sierras). The city lies at the base of the [Alabaster Sierras](alabaster-sierra-range) where the mountains wrap around the northern tip of the peninsula. The massive [Parchwood Timberland](parchwood-timberland) completely surrounds the city and a single road called the [Alabaster Trail](alabaster-trail) leads south to [Turst Fields](turst-fields) and the rest of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei).

**Castle Ward**. The Castle Ward is home to [Castle Whitestone](castle-whitestone) and its grounds. It is on the north end of the city and up on a hill that overlooks the entire city.
- [Castle Whitestone](castle-whitestone)
- [Whitestone Riflemen Barracks](whitestone-riflemen)

**Common Ward**. The Common Ward is a working class neighborhood on the southern side of the city. It is just inside the main gate off the [Alabaster Trail](alabaster-trail).
- [Estate of the Mistress of the Grey Hunt](grey-hunt)
- [Lady's Chamber](ladys-chamber)

**Dawnfather Square**. The heart of the city, Dawnfather Square is a large square filled with shops, market stalls, and inns. At the center of the Square stands the massive [Sun Tree](sun-tree).
- [Sun Tree](sun-tree)
- [Ziggurat of Whitestone](ziggurat-of-whitestone)

**Greyfields**. The Greyfields is the cemetary and temple district of the city and houses temples to [Pelor](pelor) and the [Raven Queen](raven-queen).
- [Altar of the Raven](altar-of-the-raven)
- [Zenith](zenith)

**Northern Ward**. The Northern Ward is the more affluent part of the city and sits between Dawnfather Square and the Castle Ward.
- [Paleguard Barracks](paleguard-barracks)

**Surrounding Area**. The city of Whitestone is surrounded by the [Parchwood Timberland](parchwood-timberland) and living outside the city is dangerous. Still, small farming communities, lumber and mining camps dot the landscape.

##### Architecture
Buildings in Whitestone are mostly built from expertly cut stone and lumber. The architectural style is reminiscent of buildings from the [de Rolo's](house-of-de-rolo) native [Wildemount](wildemount).

##### Defenses
Whitestone has a large, stone wall that completely encompasses the entire city. A number of gates allow local citizens to pass in and out of the city and each gate is well-guarded by the city's [Paleguard](paleguard).

On a hill overlooking the city is a large keep called [Castle Whitestone](castle-whitestone). the keep is home to the [de Rolo family](house-of-de-rolo) and [Chamber of Whitestone](chamber-of-whitestone). It is defended by an elite, firearm equipped unit called the [Whitestone Riflemen](whitestone-riflemen).

While the nearby villages are patrolled by the [Paleguard](paleguard), the [Grey Hunt](grey-hunt) protect the city by hunting monstrosities and beasts in the surrounding [Parchwood Timberland](parchwood-timberland) and [Alabaster Sierra Range](alabaster-sierra-range).

In addition to the traditional defenses, the city of Whitestone is protected by an Illusory Barrier that was built during in 815 PD. The barrier is a collection of obelisks made of whitestone and positioned around the city. When activated, they form an illusory dome of unspoiled wilderness over the entire city.

The barrier is powered by the expenditure of spell slots. All five obelisks must be active at the same time for the barrier to work.
- 2 Hours = 1 spell level x 5

##### Demographics

##### Government
The city of Whitestone is governed by the [Chamber of Whitestone](chamber-of-whitestone), a council led by the [de Rolo family](house-of-de-rolo) and includes leaders from the community.

##### Law & Order
Crime is low in Whitestone. The [Clasp](clasp) and [Myriad](myriad) maintain some presence in the city, but not nearly to the extent in the other cities of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei). 

##### Religion
The dominant religion in Whitestone is that of [Pelor](pelor). The [de Rolos](house-de-rolo) are ardent supporters of the Dawn Father and their faith played a pivotal role in the city's founding.

The [Sun Tree](sun-tree) in Dawnfather Square is a constant reminder of the city's devotion to [Pelor](pelor) as is the [Zenith](zenith) in the Greyfields.

While not as prevalent as [Pelor](pelor), [Erathis the Law Bearer](erathis) also has a strong presence in the city. The [Lady's Chamber](ladys-chamber) is located in the southwestern corner of the city in the Common Ward.

Worship of the [Raven Queen](raven-queen) became more common in 815 PD when the [Altar of the Raven](altar-of-the-raven) was constructed behind the [Temple of the Dawn](temple-of-the-dawn) in the Greyfields.

##### Services
Despite being a relatively small city, Whitestone's remote location and history of isolationism have made the city more self-sufficient than other cities of its size might be. As a result, it has a little more to offer in the way of professional services.

<!-- {blockquote: .paper} -->

##### Society
The people of Whitestone are tough folk. The city was founded by the [de Rolo family](house-of-de-rolo) in the early 600s and a frontier spirit has become central to their ethos. That combined with years of occupation under the Briarwoods in the early 800s has created a culture that prides itself on self-reliance and perserverance.

##### Trade & Industry
The chief export of the city is a chalk-white rock called 'whitestone' that is infused with magical properties. The material can be refined into a green glass-like substance called residuum that increases its potency. It has a number of uses to arcane spellcasters and is highly desired by mages throughout [Exandria](geography). The material can be refined into a green glass-like substance called residuum that increases its potency.
