# Tal'Dorei 

The continent of Tal'Dorei is located in the heart of [Exandria](exandria), nestled between the continents of [Issylra](Issylra) to the west and [Wildemount](wildemount) to the east. While not as large as [Issylra](Issylra) or as populous as [Wildemount](wildemount), [Tal'Dorei](taldorei) is growing at an incredibly fast pace.  The slowest to recover following the Calamity, Tal'Dorei has made up for lost time and is growing in both wealth and power.

## Alabaster Sierras
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei)

^Area:^ **^137,181^ ^sq^ ^mi^** ^-^ ^Population:^ **^4,865^**

The Alabaster Sierras are a wild, untamed wilderness tucked into the northeast corner of the continent of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei). While the region is named for the chalk-white [mountains](alabaster-sierra-range) that run through the heart of the region, it is dominated by the massive forest known as the [Parchwood Timberland](parchwood-timberland).

##### Climate
The region has a ***humid continental climate (Dfb)*** with cold, snowy, prolonged winters and warm short summers.

##### Demographics
The region is predominantly **human** (68%) with relatively small **halfling** (7%) and **dwarven** (6%) communities. 

The other races of [Exandria](exandria) are evenly distributed among the remaining XX%.

##### Economy
The chief export is the magically infused "whitestone" that gives the [Alabaster Sierras](alabaster-sierra-range) their distinctive color. 

Mundane stone, timber, and represent the majority of the region's exports.

### Alabaster Bay
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Alabaster^ ^Sierras^](alabaster-sierras)

**^Type:^** ^Coastal,^ ^Arctic,^ ^&^ ^Underwater^

Alabaster Bay is a large bay located on the eastern side of the [Alabaster Peninsula](alabaster-peninsula) in northeastern [Tal'Dorei](taldorei). Located on the northern end of the [Shearing Channel](shearing-channel), few vessels cross the bay, as most turn east toward the northern coast of [Wildemount](wildemount) and the island of [Eiselcross](eiselcross).

The western shore is rocky and cold. The [Sierras](alabaster-sierra-range) rise out of the water and flat land is hard to find. The southern shore, on the other hand, is relatively flat with the [Parchwood Timberland](parchwood-timberland) coming right to the water's edge.

### Alabaster Sierra Range
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Alabaster^ ^Sierras^](alabaster-sierras)

**^Type:^** ^Mountain^

Aptly named, the Alabaster Sierras are tall, rocky mountains of chalk-white stone. The range stretches over three hundred miles from the base of the [Alabaster Peninsula](alabaster-sierras), along the [Alabaster Bay](alabaster-bay) and around the peninsula's northern tip. 

The entirety of the [Alabaster Peninsula](alabaster-sierras) is wild, untamed wilderness and the Sierras are no different. [Behirs](/monster/behir), [harpies](/monster/harpy), and [wyverns](/monster/wyvern) call the mountains home, as do a number of [stone giant](/monster/stone-giant) clans. The city of [Whitestone](whitestone) is the only outpost of [human](humans) civilization on the peninsula.

Infused with magical energy, the white stone from which the mountains get their name is a hot commodity in arcane circles. While the raw stone has some magical properties, it's arcane power is greatly enhanced once it has been refined into a green glass-like substance called [residuum](/item/residuum). It is a lucrative export for the city of [Whitestone](whitestone) and numerous quarries dot the northern end of the Alabaster Sierras.

### Alabaster Trail
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Alabaster^ ^Sierras^](alabaster-sierras)

**^Type:^** ^Forest^

The Alabaster Trail is the only road linking the city of [Whitestone](whitestone) in northeastern [Tal'Dorei](taldorei) to the rest of the continent. It stretches a little over 350 miles from  [Whitestone](whitestone) in the north to the town of [Turst Fields](turst-fields) in the eastern [Dividing Plains](dividing-plains).

The Trail is a dangerous road. The northern and southern ends are well patroled by the [Paleguard](paleguard) and [Shields of the Plains](shields-of-the-plains), but the majority of the road winds through the dark and dangerous [Parchwood Timberland](parchwood-timberland).

[Bandits](/monster/bandit), [gnolls](/monster/gnoll) and [orcs](/monster/orcs) are a constant threat on the southern end, but even they avoid the stretch through the forest. Dire beasts and the undead have been known to harass travelers along the road.

### Dawnmist Bay
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Alabaster^ ^Sierras^](alabaster-sierras)

**^Type:^** ^Coastal^ ^&^ ^Underwater^

Located on the western side of the [Alabaster Peninsula](alabaster-sierras), the [Dawnmist Bay](dawnmist-bay) is a large, sheltered bay that drives deep into the continent of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei). While an extension of the [Frigid Depths](frigid-depths), the [Dawnmist Bay](dawnmist-bay) is warmer than its sister, the [Alabaster Bay](alabaster-bay) on the eastern side of the peninsula. 

Named for the heavy banks of fog that roll off the eastern slope of the [Cliffkeep Mountains](cliffkeep-mountain-range), the [Dawnmist Bay](dawnmist-bay) and [Dawnmist Pines](dawnmist-pines) are often obscured by light fog. Only during the exceptionally warm months of summer does the fog burn off by midday.

### Parchwood Bay
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Alabaster^ ^Sierras^](alabaster-sierras)

**^Type:^** ^Coastal^ ^&^ ^Underwater^

Parchwood Bay is a large bay choked with tree covered islands and rocky shoals. Located on the western side of the [Shearing Channel](shearing-channel), the bay seems like a safe place to seek shelter from the storms that plague the passage between the continents of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei) and [Wildemount](wildemount).

Unfortunately for many a captain, ships can easily become lost in the maze of islands and wreck on any of the numerous rocky shoals that hide beneath the surface of the deceptively calm waters of the bay.

### Parchwood Timberland
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Alabaster^ ^Sierras^](alabaster-sierras)

**^Type:^** ^Forest^

Dominating the northeastern corner of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei) is the dark and dense Parchwood Timberland. A massive forest, wild, untamed, and largely unexplored. Few dare to stray from the [Alabaster Trail](alabaster-trail) travelling between [Whitestone](whitestone) and [Turst Fields](turst-fields) and many who do are never seen again.

The Parchwood Timberland is an extremely dangerous forest that teems with monstrosities, undead, lycans, and corrupted plant-life. Even the [gnolls](gnolls) of eastern [Tal'Dorei](taldorei), like the [Moonsteeth](moonsteeth-gnolls) and [Priest-Eaters](priest-eater-gnolls) stick to the southern edge of the forest.

The southern edge of the forest marks the southern boundary between the [Alabaster Sierras](alabaster-sierras) in the north and the [Dividing Plains](dividing-plains) and [Lucidian Coast](lucidian-coast) to the south.

### Salted Bluffs
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Alabaster^ ^Sierras^](alabaster-sierras)

**^Type:^** ^Coastal^ ^&^ ^Mountain^

The Salted Bluffs are tall, seaside cliffs that run along the northern tip of the [Alabaster Peninsula](alabaster-sierras) where the [Alabaster Sierras](alabaster-sierra-range) meet the Frigid Depths. The cliffs are littered with caves and hidden coves and often used by pirates and smugglers. 

The cliffs are also home to a number of dangerous beasts and creatures including the [Ashwing Harpies](ashwing-harpies) and [wyverns](/monster/wyvern).

### Shearing Channel
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Alabaster^ ^Sierras^](alabaster-sierras)

**^Type:^** ^Coastal^ ^&^ ^Underwater^

The Shearing Channel is a narrow passage between the continents of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei) in the west and [Wildemount](wildemount) in the east. It connects the remote ports on the [Frigid Depths](frigid-depths) from the [Lucidian Ocean](lucidian-ocean) and the rest of [Exandria's](exandria) lucrative ports.

Passage through the Shearing Channel is extremely dangerous. Extreme weather and rough seas are the norm, rather than the exception. The channel and nearby [Parchwood Bay](parchwood-bay) are full of shipwrecks and the monsters that feed on them.

*^Canon^ ^Consistency:^ ^High^ ^-^ ^(Tal'Dorei^ ^Campaign^ ^Guide,^ ^p.^ ^46)^*





### Upper Mooren River Run
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Alabaster^ ^Sierras^](alabaster-sierras)

**^Type:^** ^Forest^

The Upper Mooren River Run begins its nearly 600 mile journey high in the [Alabaster Sierras](alabaster-sierra-range) and ends in the town of [Drynna](drynna) on the northwestern shore of [Mooren Lake](mooren-lake), passing the city of [Whitestone](whitestone) along the way.

As the river makes it's way south, it gains strength from countless streams and smaller rivers that flow down from the Alabasters along the way. It roars through the [Parchwood Timberland](parchwood-timberland) and then widens and slows through the eastern [Dividing Plains](dividing-plains).

The Upper Mooren River Run is barely navigable. There are numerous falls and intense rapids at various points along the river. It is most certainly a one-way trip with travel up-river impossible by non-magical means.

*^Canon^ ^Consistency:^ ^High^ ^-^ ^(Tal'Dorei^ ^Campaign^ ^Guide,^ ^p.^ ^46)^*



> While technically the same river, the portions of the Mooren River Run above and below [Mooren Lake](mooren-lake) could not be more different. As such, I have created separate entries for the [Upper Mooren River Run](upper-mooren-river-run) and the [Lower Mooren River Run](lower-mooren-river-run).

[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei)

^Area:^ **^137,181^ ^sq^ ^mi^** ^-^ ^Population:^ **^333,268^**

The Bladeshimmer Shoreline is located on the central, western coast of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei). It stretches from the southern base of the [Daggerbay Mountains](daggerbay-mountains) to the northern edge of the [Seashale Mountains](seashale-mountains) and as far east as the [Ivyheart Thicket](ivyheart-thicket) and [Ironseat Ridge](ironseat-ridge). It is a rocky coastline with rolling hills and plains further inland.

##### Climate
The Bladeshimmer Shoreline has a **warm temperate oceanic (Cfb)** climate. It has cool, wet winters, and mild summers with a fair amount of precipitation.

### Bladeshimmer Bay
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Bladeshimmer^ ^Shoreline^](bladeshimmer-shoreline)

**^Type:^** ^Coastal^ ^&^ ^Underwater^

The Bladeshimmer Bay is a large, open bay on the west coast of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei). It stretches from the [Seashale Mountains](seashale-mountains) in the north, down the [Bladeshimmer Shoreline](bladeshimmer-shoreline) and ends at a point due west of [Daggerbay](daggerbay).

The Bladeshimmer Bay is not sheltered from the open [Ozmit Sea](ozmit-sea), but the waters are relatively calm and the weather temperate. It is heavily travelled by merchant ships and fishers operating out of the Port of [Emon](emon).

While the bay is well-patroled and relatively safe, [sahuagin](/monster/sahuagin) clans and pirates operating out of the [Ruins of O'Noa](ruins-of-onoa) occassionally trouble merchants bound for [Marquet](marquet) or [Wildemount](wildemount).

### Crystalfen Caverns
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Bladeshimmer^ ^Shoreline^](bladeshimmer-shoreline)

**^Type:^** ^Underdark^

Crystalfen Caverns is a massive network of underground tunnels, caverns, and rivers that date back to [Exandria's](exandria) founding. Home to an ancient aboleth civilization, the Crystalfen Caverns are extremely perilous. The Crystalfen Caverns are home to the ancient aboleth city of [Salar](ruins-of-salar), a city nearly destroyed during the Calamity, but slowly being rebuilt.

Throughout the caverns are veins of blue crystal called azuremite. This blue crystal can be ground and refined into a powder with powerful arcane properties called [Suude](/item/suude).

### Daggerbay
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Bladeshimmer^ ^Shoreline^](bladeshimmer-shoreline)

**^Type:^** ^Coastal^ ^&^ ^Underwater^

Daggerbay is a small bay on the southern end of the [Bladeshimmer Shoreline](bladeshimmer-shoreline). The bay is sheltered from the rough waters of the southern [Ozmit Sea](ozmit-sea), but the entrance is well guarded by the jagged and dangerous [Slumber Reef](slumber-reef). 

The bay was once home to the colony of [O'noa](ruins-of-onoa), the first permanent, [human](humans) settlement on [Tal'Dorei](taldorei) following the Calamity. After O'Noa was destroyed during the [Scattered War](history), both the city and the bay were abandoned in favor of the already more prosperous [Emon](emon).

Over time, the bay became a haven for pirates and [sahuagin](/monster/sahuagin) with the occassional foolhardy treasure hunter looking to salvage treasure from the countless wrecks on the [Slumber Reef](slumber-reef).

[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Bladeshimmer^ ^Shoreline^](bladeshimmer-shoreline)

**^Type:^** ^Mountain^ ^&^ ^Hill^

The Daggerbay Mountains are jagged, rocky peaks located on the southern end of the [Bladeshimmer Shoreline](bladeshimmer-shoreline). Due east of [Daggerbay](daggerbay), the mountains serve as a border between the [elven](elves) nation of [Syngorn](syngorn) and the [human](humans) [Republic of Tal'Dorei](council-of-taldorei). 

Located on the northern end of range, the [Emerald Outpost](emerald-outpost) keeps watch over the [Emerald Path](emerald-path) and protects the valuable trade caravans that pass between the two nations. 

Clans of [stone](/monster/stone-giant) and [hill](/monster/hill-giant) giants regularly harass travelers and raid supply wagons, as do [bandits](/monster/bandits) operating out of the [ruins of O'Noa](ruins-of-onoa).

**^Type:^** ^Coastal^ ^&^ ^Grassland^

The Emerald Path is the main road that leads from the [human](humans) city of [Emon](emon) to the [elven](elves) city of [Syngorn](syngorn). It winds its way down the [Bladeshimmer Shoreline](bladeshimmer-shoreline) passing close to the [Ruins of O'Noa](onoa) before turning east toward the [Daggerbay Mountains](daggerbay-mountains) and the [Emerald Outpost](emerald-outpost). It continues through the mountains and joins the [Wildwood Byway](wildwood-byway) on it's way south to [Syngorn](syngorn).

The Emerald Path is well patrolled by both the [Arms of Emon](arms-of-emon) and the [Verdant Guard](verdant-guard). The stretches nearest [Emon](emon), [Emerald Outpost](emerald-outpost) and [Syngorn](syngorn) being the safest. The stretch through the [Daggerbay Mountains](daggerbay-mountains) is heavily patrolled, but is still quite dangerous. Likewise, the stretch nearest the ruined city of [O'noa](ruins-of-onoa) is plagued by bandits operating out of the ancient ruined city.

### Emerald River
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Bladeshimmer^ ^Shoreline^](bladeshimmer-shoreline)

**^Type:^** ^Grassland^

The Emerald River is a shallow, rocky river that descends from the [Daggerbay Mountains](daggerbay-mountains) south of the [Emerald Outpost](emerald-outpost) and out onto the plains of the [Bladeshimmer Shoreline](bladeshimmer-shoreline). It travels west nearly 150 miles where it joins the [Ivyheart Run](ivyheart-run) before emptying into the [Ozmit Sea](ozmit-sea).

The Emerald River is navigable via small boats for much of its lower course. It starts as a rushing torrent of water in the [Daggerbay Mountains](daggerbay-mountains), but quickly widens and shallows as it hits the plains. 

The [Emerald Path](emerald-path) follows the river for most of its course before diverging at the base of the mountains and heading due east to the [Emerald Outpost](emerald-outpost).

**^Type:^** ^Forest^ ^&^ ^Elemental^

Flamereach Grove is a small forest located about a day's walk east of the city of [Emon](emon). The forest was known as the [Shivergreen Grove](shivergreen-grove) until [Thordak the Cinder King](thordak-cinder-king) and the [Chroma Conclave](chroma-conclave) attacked in 815 PD. 

After the attack the surrounding area was turned into the "Scar of the Cinder King" and the forest continues to burn to this day. The trees in the forest are charred black and the forest floor is covered in continuously burning embers and ash.

The forest sits on the edge of the [Snowember Fields](snowember-fields) and a squat, stone fortress called the [Flamereach Outpost](flamereach-outpost) keeps watch over both.

Ivyheart Run is a small river that begins deep within the [Ivyheart Thicket](ivyheart-thicket) of the [Dividing Plains](dividing-plains) and heads west over the plains of the [Bladeshimmer Shoreline](bladeshimmer-shoreline) to the [Ozmit Sea](ozmit-sea).

The Ivyheart Run is not a big, deep, or fast-moving river, but it is navigable via small boat for much of its 300 mile course. Wide open grasslands and the occassional grove of trees line the banks. 

Shortly before it's arrival at the sea, the Run joins with the [Emerald River](emerald-river) north of the ruined city of [O'Noa](ruins-of-onoa).

[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Bladeshimmer^ ^Shoreline^](bladeshimmer-shoreline)

**^Type:^** ^Coastal^ ^&^ ^Mountain^

The Nightwash Tide is a series of interconnected bays, coves and lagoons at the base of the[Seashale Mountains](seashale-mountains) on the northern end of the [Bladeshimmer Shoreline](bladeshimmer-shoreline). Many of these bays extend deep into the heart of the mountains and twist and turn into a labyrinth of brackish water.

The Nightwash is a seemingly endless supply of food for the villages of the [Shalesteps](shalesteps) and their chief export. Fish and other marine life is washed in with the tide from the [Ozmit Sea](ozmit-sea) and trapped in the lagoon. Fishers from the nearby village of [Puddlefoot](shalesteps) rarely have to venture out into the open-water to fill their nets for the day.

Fishing the Nightwash is not without risks. The same tide that brings in fish, occassionally brings in creatures a little too dangerous for the fishers to deal with on their own.

### Othendin Trail
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Bladeshimmer^ ^Shoreline^](bladeshimmer-shoreline)

**^Type:^** ^Grassland^ ^&^ ^Mountain^

The Othendin Trail is a long road that winds its way north from the bustling city of [Emon](emon), past the [Shalestep Mountains](shalestep-mountains) and on to the [Othendin Pass](othendin-pass). For the soldiers stationed at [Fort Daxio](fort-daxio), it is their only connection to [Emon](emon) and the [Council of Tal'Dorei](council-of-taldorei).

The trail is heavily patrolled by the [Arms of Emon](arms-of-emon) near the city and by the [army](army-of-taldorei) in the pass, but is relatively unguarded for much of its length. Fortunately, the regularity of military traffic and supply caravans does provide some degree of protection to travelers.

### Ruins of Salar
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Bladeshimmer^ ^Shoreline^](bladeshimmer-shoreline)

**^Type:^** ^Underdark^

The city of Salar was once a great [aboleth](/monster/aboleth) city located deep within the [Crystalfen Caverns](crystalfen-caverns) beneath the [Bladeshimmer Shoreline](bladeshimmer-shoreline). The city thrived during the Age of Arcanum but was nearly destroyed during the Calamity. The city is a shadow of its former self, but it is rebuilding.

The architecture of Salar is completely alien to the [races](races) of Exandria. Those who know of its existence call it the "Unseeable City" because those who look upon it are known to have descended into madness. The city is illuminated by a massive pearlescent disc, called the Moon Disc.

### Ruins of Vos'Sykriss
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Bladeshimmer^ ^Shoreline^](bladeshimmer-shoreline)

**^Type:^** ^Jungle^

Vos'Sykriss was a large city located on the larger of the two islands known as [Visa Isle](visa-isle). It was the capital city and crowning jewel of a [Yuan-Ti](yuan-ti) civilization and it dominated the coast of southwestern [Tal'Dorei](tal'dorei). 

The [Yuan-Ti](yuan-ti) civilization fell during the [Calamity](history) and much of the city of Vos'Sykriss' fell into ruin. Over time, what remained of the [Yuan-Ti](yuan-ti) simply vanished from the face of [Exandria](exandria).

Undead [Yuan-Ti](yuan-ti) still patrol and defend their ancestral home, while countless others lie in a form of stasis or hibernation deep within the ancient halls of the city. 

In the early 800s, an expedition from the [Alabaster Lyceum](alabaster-lyceum) explored the ruined city and brought back many artifacts. Shortly after their departure, the [Yuan-Ti](yuan-ti) began to awaken from their slumber.

**^Type:^** ^Forest,^ ^Grassland,^ ^&^ ^Elemental^

The Scar of the Cinder King refers to an area east of [Emon](emon) that was ravaged by [Thordak](thordak) during the [Chroma Conclave's](chroma-conclave) assault in 812 P.D. The area includes the ever-burning [Flamereach Grove](flamereach-grove), [Snowember Fields](snowember-fields), and the [Flamereach Outpost](flamereach-outpost). 

The area is heavily scarred and cursed by elemental magic. Creatures from the [Elemental Plane of Fire](elemental-plane-of-fire) roam the area and druids from the Fire [Ashari](ashari) of [Pyrah](pyrah) and scholars from the [Alabaster Lyceum](alabaster-lyceum) are working together to monitor the area and hopefully reverse the damage.

**^Type:^** ^Forest^

The Shivergreen Gove was a small forest about a day's walk east of the city of [Emon](emon). It was a relatively safe wood, surrounded by small farming villages and just off the [Silvercut Roadway](silvercut-roadway). Farming villages dotted the countryside and the grove was an important source of game and timber.

In 815 PD, the forest was destroyed by Thordak the Cinder King and transformed into the ever-burning [Flamereach Grove](flamereach-grove). The surrounding farmland transformed into the [Snowember Fields](snowember-fields).

### Slumber Reef
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Bladeshimmer^ ^Shoreline^](bladeshimmer-shoreline)

**^Type:^** ^Coastal^ ^&^ ^Underwater^

Slumber Reef is a large natural reef that guards the entrance to [Daggerbay](daggerbay). The sharp rocks and hidden coral reef make entering the bay dangerous for ships, but the shelter it provides was instrumental in the success of the early settlement of [O'Noa](ruins-of-onoa). 

Safely navigating through the reef takes skill and many a captain confident in their abilities has found themselves swimming to shore among the many sharks and creatures that call the reef home.

### Snowember Fields
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Bladeshimmer^ ^Shoreline^](bladeshimmer-shoreline)

**^Type:^** ^Grassland^ ^&^ ^Elemental^

Located within the area east of [Emon](emon) known as the [Scar of the Cinder King](scar-of-the-cinder-king), the Snowember Fields is a large tract of farmland ruined by the ancient red dragon [Thordak](thordak). The entire area is covered in white ash with the occassional burnt farmhouse or barn. From a distance the Snowember looks like a snowy plain. Underneath this ash, however are ever-smoldering embers.

Creatures from the [Elemental Plane of Fire](elemental-plane-of-fire) live beneath the ash and travelling through the fields runs the risk of disturbing them.

*^Canon^ ^Consistency:^ ^High^ ^-^ ^(Tal'Dorei^ ^Campaign^ ^Guide,^ ^p.^ ^96)^*




> In the Tal'Dorei Campaign Guide, the author indicates a [magmin](/monster/magmin) will spring from the ash for every 5 feet walked in the fields. This must be an exageration. A simple trek by a party of four a 1/2 mile into the fields would spawn 2,118 [magmin](/monster/magmin).
>
> In my experience, we tended to encounter them a lot less frequently. Every hour we had about a 10% chance of disturbing some elemental creatures such as: [magmin](/monster/magmin), [cinderslags](/monster/cinderslag-elementals), and even some [fire elementals](/monster/fire-elementals).*

Visa Isle is actually two seperate islands located off the coast of the [Bladeshimmer Shoreline](bladeshimmer-shoreline) and [Verdant Expanse](verdant-expanse) in the [Ozmit Sea](ozmit-sea). 

The islands are highly volcanic with active volcanos spewing ash into the sky. Everything from the base of the peaks to the black sand beaches is covered in thick, tropical jungle.

The bigger of the two islands is home to the ruins of [Vos'Sykriss](ruins-of-vossykriss). An ancient city of a long vanished [Yuan-Ti](yuan-ti) civilization.

### Cliffkeep Mountain Range
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Cliffkeep^ ^Mountains^](cliffkeep-mountains)

**^Type:^** ^Mountain^

The Cliffkeep Mountains is a massive mountain range that covers nearly one-third of the entire continent of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei). The entire range stretches from the [Dividing Plains](dividing-plains) in the center of the continent, all the way to the ice-cold [Frigid Depths](frigid-depths) far to the north. 

Due to its massive size, the Cliffkeeps are often subdivided into five distinct ranges.

##### Eastern Range
The eastern range of the Cliffkeeps runs along the western shore of the [Dawnmist Bay](dawnmist-bay) from the [Dawnmist Pines](dawnmist-pines) in the south, along the eastern side of the [Black Valley](black-valley) to the [Neverfields](neverfields).

##### Gatshadow Spur
The Gatshadow Spur is a range that shoots down between the southern and eastern ranges towards the [Dividing Plains](dividing-plains). It frames the western side of the [Black Valley](black-valley) and comes to an abrupt halt at the massive [Gatshadow](gatshadow).

##### Northern Range
The northern range of the Cliffkeeps runs up through the center of the region, along the western edge of the [Grey Valley](grey-valley) to the [Elvenpeaks](elvenpeaks) and the city of [Lyrengorn](lyrengorn).

##### Southern Range
The southern range of the Cliffkeeps begins at the [Othendin Pass](othendin-pass) and runs along the northern border of the [Torian Forest](torian-forest) and ends east of the dwarven city of [Kraghammer](kraghammer) at the start of the Gatshadow Spur. 

##### Western Range
The western range of the Cliffkeeps is located in the nortwestern corner of the region. It includes the small chain west of the [Othendin Pass](othendin-pass), breaks north of [Fort Daxio](fort-daxio) and continues north along the northwest coast of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei).

*^Canon^ ^Consistency:^ ^Medium^ ^-^ ^(Tal'Dorei^ ^Campaign^ ^Guide,^ ^p.^ ^80)^*




> Due to the sheer enormity of the Cliffkeep Mountains, the various ranges are known by many names to many peoples. While these ranges are not identified on any previous maps, I decided to adopt the logical names for these ranges as given by the [dwarves](dwarves) of [Kraghammer](kraghammer) and translated into Common.

[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Cliffkeep^ ^Mountains^](cliffkeep-mountains)

**^Type:^** ^Mountain^ ^&^ ^Arctic^

Despite it's name, the Elvenpeaks is a single mountain that has been split in the middle, by a long, slow-moving glacier. On either side of the glacier stand tall, rocky peaks. It lies at the far northern tip of the [Cliffkeep Mountains'](cliffkeep-mountain-range) northernmost range and it is the last major mountain before the endless frozen wastes of the [Neverfields](neverfields).

While the mountain and surrounding area are cold and inhospitable, a warm, temperate forest thrives beneath the ice sheet suspended between the peaks. Inside, lies the elven city of [Lyrengorn](lyrengorn), a bastion of elven culture far removed from the influence of [Syngorn](syngorn).

Othendin Pass is a large valley that divides the southern and western ranges of the [Cliffkeep Mountains](cliffkeep-mountain-range). The area is newly settled by [human](humans) from the [Bladeshimmer Shoreline](bladeshimmer-shoreline) and has come under the protection of the [Republic of Tal'Dorei](republic-of-taldorei) with the construction of [Fort Daxio](fort-daxio) after the Scattered War.

The area was once home to a number of [stone giant](/monster/stone-giant) clans that have since been pushed deeper into the mountains. Conflicts between the giants and the settlers are common and usually violent.

### Pools of Wittebak
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Cliffkeep^ ^Mountains^](cliffkeep-mountains)

**^Type:^** ^Hill^ ^&^ ^Mountain^

The Pools of Wittebak are a series of hot springs located to the northeast of the city of [Kraghammer](kraghammer) in the central range of the [Cliffkeep Mountains](cliffkeep-mountain-range). The pools sit directly above the ruined [gnomish](gnomes) city of [Wittebak](ruins-of-wittebak).

The pools are a favorite of local [hill giants](/monster/hill-giant) and it was their playing in the pools that lead to the destruction of [Wittebak](ruins-of-wittebak). Cracks opened up in the city and vented noxious gas into the city and killed thousands of [gnomes](gnomes) in a single night.

The survivors relocated to [Kraghammer](kraghammer) and the [giants](/monster/hill-giant) now claim dominion over the pools and view it as their ancestral home.

[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Cliffkeep^ ^Mountains^](cliffkeep-mountains)

**^Type:^** ^Mountain^ ^&^ ^Underdark^

Located beneath the [Pools of Wittebak](pools-of-wittebak) is the ruined, [gnomish](gnomes) city of Wittebak. Once home to more than three thousand [gnomes](gnomes), Wittebak was destroyed around 415 PD when a clan of [hill giants](/monster/hill-giant) caused a crack to vent noxious gases into the city while they played in the [pools](pools-of-wittebak) above. Those that survived, moved to [Kraghammer](kraghammer) where they were welcomed, somewhat reluctantly by the insular [dwarves](dwarves).

The city is divided into three tiers, each with it's own challenges.

**Tinkerer's Tier**. The topmost level of Wittebak is breathable, but only to a point. A creature not accustomed to the environment can stand a number of hours equal to their constitution modifier before they start taking 1d6 poison damage for each minute beyond that.

Local [hill giants](/monster/hill-giant) have adapted to the gas and move about the top tier freely.

**Homesteads**. The second level is much more noxious and anyone down longer than an hour begins taking damage. The entire level is like a tomb with many of the long dead gnomes still interred here. Water leaks from the pools and falls above.

**Engine Core**. The lowest level is full of complex gearworks and industrial wonders, but it is flooded and crawling with [merrow](/monster/merrow) and is home to a [sea hag](/monster/sea-hag) named Mauvlettir and her lair.

### Serpent's Head
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Cliffkeep^ ^Mountains^](cliffkeep-mountains)

**^Type:^** ^Mountain,^ ^Forest,^ ^&^ ^Elemental^

Serpent's Head was a small, village located on a squat mountain of the same name in the southern range of the [Cliffkeep Mountains](cliffkeep-mountain-range) near the [Torian Forest](torian-forest). It was completely destroyed in 811 PD by [Thordak the Cinder King](thordak-the-cinder-king) for reasons unknown.

The village predominantly consisted of [dwarves](dwarves) and [humans](humans) and while most of the inhabitants fled to [Kraghammer](kraghammer) some stayed and perished in the ancient red dragon's assault. What little remains of the village is now a smoking volcano surrounded by fields of ash and cinders. Numerous dangerous creatures of the fire plane now call the nearby mines and caverns home.

**^Type:^** ^Hill^ ^&^ ^Mountain^

The Umbra Hills were once a lush and verdant landscape known as the Emerald Highlands. The hills were rich with minerals and wildlife and drew settlers from the [Dividing Plains](dividing-plains) to form the town of [Jorenn Village](jorenn-village) on the southern edge of the hills.

In the [Battle of the Umbra Hills](history), the combined forces of [Syngorn](syngorn) and [Zan Tal'Dorei](taldorei-zan) defeated the forces of [King Trist Drassig](drassig-trist) and [Graz'zt](grazzt-the-demon-prince-of-indulgence) to end the [Scattered War](history). In the aftermath, the hills were permanently scarred and nothing except the shadegrass, for which the hills are now famous will grow there.

Located on the western edge of the [Ivyheart Thicket](ivyheart-thicket), the Blazing Foundry is all that remains of an ancient [Founding Age](founding) settlement. While some of the ruins were left intact, much of the settlement was destroyed by [Thordak](thordak) on his way to [Emon](emon) during the reign of the [Chroma Conclave](chroma-conclave).

Very little is known about these ruins, but archaeologists from the [Alabaster Lyceum](alabaster-lyceum) are investigating the ruins.

### Bramblewood
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Dividing^ ^Plains^](dividing-plains)

**^Type:^** ^Forest^

The Bramblewood is a large forest that stretches along most of the eastern slope of the [Cliffkeep Mountain's](cliffkeep-mountain-range) [Gatshadow](gatshadow) spur. It begins in the [Black Valley](black-valley) to the north, skirts the western edge of [Westruun](westruun) and around the southern face of the massive [Gatshadow](gatshadow).

Aptly named, the Bramblewood is a tangled mess of oak-like trees with long, razor-sharp thorns protruding from the tree's bark. The combination of a thick undergrowth, tangled roots, and dagger-like thorns makes a simple stroll in the forest a dangerous affair. Add in the various monstrosities and beasts that call the Bramblewood home and it is easy to understand why the locals stick to the edges.

### Byhills River
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Dividing^ ^Plains^](dividing-plains)

**^Type:^** ^Mountain^ ^&^ ^Grassland^

The Byhills River is a long river that begins high in the southern range of [Cliffkeep Mountains](cliffkeep-mountain-range) and winds southward through the [Dividing Plains](dividing-plains), across the [Silvercut Roadway](silvercut-roadway) to the [Foramere Basin](foramere-basin) at the base of the [Stormcrest Mountains](stormcrest-mountains).

Formed by a number of smaller streams beginning in the southern [Cliffkeeps](cliffkeep-mountain-range), most of the Byhills' force comes from two major tributaries. The [Wildwood](wildwood-forest) branch begins in the [Wildwood](wildwood-forest) east of [Kraghammer](kraghammer), while the [Torian](torian-forest) branch begins southwest of the city in the eastern [Torian Forest](torian-forest).

The upper branches of the river are small, rocky, and forceful. The river widens and calms some as it enters the plains, but is still swift. It is roughly 360 miles from either of it's sources to the [Foramere Basin](foramere-basin).

*^Canon^ ^Consistency:^ ^High^ ^-^ ^(Tal'Dorei^ ^Campaign^ ^Guide,^ ^p.^ ^80)^*

[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Dividing^ ^Plains^](dividing-plains)

**^Type:^** ^Coastal^ ^&^ ^Grassland^

Foramere Basin is a large, crystal clear lake located in the heart of the [Dividing Plains](dividing-plains). The lake was once the ice fortress of [Errevon the Rimelord](errevon) during the [Icelost Years](history). When [Errevon](errevon) was defeated and bansihed to his home plane, the fortress melted and became the lake.

The lake is replenished by snowmelt from the [Cliffkeep Mountains](cliffkeep-mountain-range) by the [Byhills River](byhills-river) and the [Stormcrest Mountains](stormcrest-mountains) by the [Tundrun River](tundrun-river). The [Foramere Waterway](foramere-waterway) leaves the eastern side of the lake and empties into the [Lucidian Ocean](lucidian-ocean) in the [Owlset Bay](owlset-bay).

The Foramere is an important source of fresh fish to central [Tal'Dorei](taldorei) and a number of small fishing villages dot the western shore. The largest is the village of [Foramere](foramere).

Ironseat Ridge is a small ridge that lies on the western edge of the [Dividing Plains](dividing-plains) of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei). The ridge, looks vaguely like a chair and is a prominent landmark to travelers on both the cross-continental [Silvercut Roadway](silvercut-roadway) and north-south [Wildwood Byway](wildwood-byway). 

Once home to a number of prosperous mines, the Ironseat has been largely pilfered of it's riches. Creatures of various types now prowl the abandoned mine shafts that criss-cross through it's interior.

The residents of [Kymal](kymal) can often hear the wind howling through the old tunnels and what was once a symbol of the city's prosperity is now a constant reminder of days gone by.

### Ivyheart Thicket
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Dividing^ ^Plains^](dividing-plains)

**^Type:^** ^Forest^

The Ivyheart Thicket is a dense, mess of trees and underbrush located on the western edge of the [Dividing Plains](dividing-plains). The forest lies west of the north-south running [Wildwood Byway](wildwood-byway) and surrounds much of the ruined village of [Torthil](ruins-of-torthil).

After the destruction of [Torthil](ruins-of-torthil), the forest quickly grew wilder and more dangerous. Without frequent hunters and loggers maintaining trails and camps, the undergrowth began to take hold and the forest quickly became a tangled mess.

On the western edge of the forest, ruins of an ancient, pre-[Calamity](history) civilization was recently discovered by arcane-archaeologists from the [Alabaster Lyceum](alabaster-lyceum). Little is known about the people that once lived there and it is unlikely anyone will ever uncover it's secrets. During the time of the [Chroma Conclave](chroma-conclave), [Thordak](thordak-the-cinder-king) attacked the ruin and left a fiery ruin now called the [Blazing Foundry](blazing-foundry).

The Parchwood Way is a well-traveled road that connects the settlements of [Drynna](drynna) and [Turst Fields](turst-fields) with the rest of the [Tal'Dorei Republic](council-of-taldorei). It heads northeast from the city of [Westruun](westruun) and passes south of the [Black Valley](black-valley), [Dawnmist Pines](dawnmist-pines), and [Parchwood Timberland](parchwood-timberland) linking the three settlements together.

While no road is completely safe, the Parchwood Way is heavily patrolled by the [Shields of the Plains](shields-of-the-plains) between the city of [Westruun](westruun) and [Turst Fields](turst-fields). The stretch to [Drynna](drynna) is not as heavily patrolled and raids by gnoll tribes out of the [Rootgarden Marsh](rootgarden-marsh) and southern [Parchwood Timberland](parchwood-timberland) are not uncommon.

The village of Torthil was a small village located south of [Kymal](kymal) on the [Wildwood Byway](wildwood-byway). It was an insignificant stop on the road to [Syngorn](syngorn) that now serves as a stark reminder of a brutal war waged long ago.

All that remains of Torthil are broken stone buildings and an obsidian monument to the death of [Warren Drassig](drassig-warren). The village was the sight of a well-executed ambush of Drassig's forces during the [Scattered War](history) and a subsequent massacre at the hands of Warren's son, [Neminar](drassig-neminar).

The forest is a chief source of timber for the cities of [Emon](emon) and [Kraghammer](kraghammer) and the forest is widely considered to be one of the safer forests in [Exandria](exandria).

Despite it's reputation, the Torian is still a wild and unforgiving place. It is not uncommon for dangerous creatures to come down from the mountains and there are pockets of displaced fey creatures in some of the darker corners of the forest.

The northern end of the forest transitions to damp fens and is home to the [Rivermaw Tribe](rivermaw-tribe), a nomadic tribe of disparate people who have shunned life in the more populous areas of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei).

It winds through the [K'Tawl](ktawl-swamp) for a little over a hundred miles before it reaches the [Lucidian Ocean](lucidian-ocean) at the city of [Stilben](stilben).

The K'Tawl is navigable, but it's winding route and the swamp's dangerous denizens make it impractical for travel. The [Silvercut Roadway](silvercut-roadway) follows the river for a bit, but is straighter and drier.

**^Type:^** ^Swamp^

The K'Tawl Swamp is a large bayou-like swamp that stretches 200 miles along the central portion of [Tal'Dorei's](taldorei) [Lucidian Coast](lucidian-coast). Large cypress and tupelo trees dominate the swamp and moss hangs from many of their branches. The swamp begins on the north side of the [Owlset Bay](owlset-bay), surrounds the port city of [Stilben](stilben) and ends before the mouth of the [Lower Mooren River Run](lower-mooren-river-run). 

Runoff from the [Summit Peaks](summit-peaks) to the west feeds the swamp through a number of rivers and streams including the [K'Tawl Creek](ktawl-creek) and [Knifemouth River](knifemouth-river). All of the swamp's creeks and rivers eventually find their way to the [K'Tawl Bay](ktawl-bay) and [Lucidian Ocean](lucidian-ocean) to the east.

The K'Tawl is an extremely dangerous place teeming with dangerous creatures and tribes of [orcs](orcs), [lizardfolk](lizardfolk), [bullywugs](/monster/bullywug), [grung](/monster/grung), and [sahuagin](/monster/sahuagin). Most of the tribes are content to live in peace, but they tend to be fiercely territorial and do not tolerate trespassers.

Unlike the [upper](upper-mooren-river-run), the lower Mooren River Run is a wide, deep, slow moving channel that connects the [Mooren Lake](mooren-lake) and the lakeside town of [Drynna](drynna) in eastern [Tal'Dorei](taldorei) to the [Lucidian Ocean](lucidian-ocean). It provides a second, albeit smaller, port for the [Republic of Tal'Dorei](council-of-taldorei) on the [Lucidian Coast](lucidian-coast) and it is an important trade route with the [Menagerie Coast](menagerie-coast) on the continent of [Wildemount](wildemount).

The lower Mooren River Run is a little over 100 miles long and is deep and wide enough for keelboats and schooners to navigate upriver to the [Mooren Lake](mooren-lake). The shore on either side of the river is coastal plain, with the easter bank a little wetter as it slowly transitions to the [Rootgarden Marsh](rootgarden-marsh) on the eastern side of the lake.

Trips up and down the lower Mooren are slow going and typically require extra security to keep pirates and opportunistic [gnolls](/monster/gnolls) or [lizardfolk](lizardfolk) from raiding the ships as they make the trip upriver.

### Mooren Lake
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Lucidian^ ^Coast^](lucidian-coast)

**^Type:^** ^Coastal^

Mooren Lake is a large, crystal-clear lake located on the [Lucidian Coast](lucidian-coast) of eastern [Tal'Dorei](taldorei). It is important source of fresh fish for much of eastern [Tal'Dorei](taldorei) and connects the lake town of [Drynna](drynna) to the [Lucidian Ocean](lucidian-ocean) via the [lower Mooren River Run](lower-mooren-river-run).

On the western banks of the lake are the rich farmlands of the eastern [Dividing Plains](dividing-plains) while the [Rootgarden Marsh](rootgarden-marsh) domintaes the entirety of the lake's eastern shore. In the center of the lake, two islands lay perpetually shrouded in mist. Rumors tell of an ageless woman known as the [Moon Mistress](moon-mistress) residing on the larger of the two.

Beneath the crystal clear surface, lies centuries of magically-infused [whitestone](/item/whitestone) that has washed down the [upper Mooren River Run](upper-mooren-river-run) from the [Alabaster Sierras](alabaster-sierra-range) far to the north. Rumors tell of strange things happening to the lake bed as a result.

### Rootgarden Marsh
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Lucidian^ ^Coast^](lucidian-coast)

**^Type:^** ^Swamp^

Rootgarden Marsh is a large marshland east of [Mooren Lake](mooren-lake). The marsh is a mixture of soggy earth, groves of trees, and brackish pools. The boundaries between the marsh and the [lake](mooren-lake) to the west and [Lucidian Ocean](lucidian-ocean) are not easily defined. Both seem to simply vanish into the Rootgarden gradually.

The Rootgarden Marsh is home to a number of humanoid tribes, but most keep to themselves and do not trouble the settlement of [Drynna](drynna) on the western bank of the [Mooren Lake](mooren-lake). The [Moonsteeth Gnolls](moonsteeth-gnolls) are the most aggressive and regularly venture out to raid the neighboring farms and villages.

In addition to the normal creatures found in a swamp, the Rootgarden is home to Manawort, a sentient fungus used in some powerful potions.

**^Type:^** ^Mountain^

The Summit Peaks is a small mountain range located in eastern [Tal'Dorei](taldorei) on the western edge of the [K'Tawl Swamp](ktawl-swamp) and located northeast of [Stilben](stilben).  

While the range is much smaller than the [Cliffkeeps](cliffkeep-mountain-range), [Stormcrests](stormcrest-mountains), or [Alabaster Sierras](alabaster-sierra-range), the Summit Peaks are very tall and steep. Compared to the lowlands of the [Dividing Plains](dividing-plains) and [Lucidian Coast](lucidian-coast), the mountains seem even taller.

High in the Summit Peaks, lies the rift to the [Elemental Plane of Air](elemental-plane-of-air) and the [Ashari](ashari) village of [Zephrah](zephrah).

### Ashen Gorge
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Stormcrest^ ^Mountains^](stormcrest-mountains)

**^Type:^** ^Mountain^ ^&^ ^Elemental^

The Ashen Gorge is a volcano located on the eastern end of the [Stormcrest Mountains](stormcrest-mountains). The mountain appears to have two distinct peaks with a large gorge between them, but the gorge, is in fact, the volcano's caldera and the twin peaks all that remains of the mountain's original peak. 

The Ashen Gorge is also known as the "Dragon's Throne" as it was the home of the [ancient red dragon](/monster/ancient-red-dragon), [Thordak the Cinder King](thordak-the-cinder-king) for many years.

The gorge is a harsh environment full of ash, streams of magma, noxious gases and smoke. As inhospitable as the gorge would appear, it is home to three competing tribes. The [Scions of Flame](scions-of-flame), the [Tinysoot](tinysoot-tribe), and the [Black Snow](black-snow-tribe). All three fight for control of the gorge and the vast riches of [Thordak's](thordak-the-cinder-king) horde.

Rumors speak of multiple hordes stashed throughout the vast network of tunnels that twist and wind through the heart of the mountain. Among them are the [Obsidian Geode](obsidian-geode) and the [Everflame Crevasse](everflame-crevasse), two of the richest and those the tribes fight over constantly.

### Dreamseep Marshlands
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Stormcrest^ ^Mountains^](stormcrest-mountains)

**^Type:^** ^Swamp^

The Dreamseep Marshlands is an expansive swamp that covers most of the northern [Kirmont Valley](kirmont-valley). Fed by countless tiny rivers, the [Dreamseep River](dreamseep-river) provides the marshland with a constant supply of murky, brown water.

Located in a remote corner of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei), the Dreamseep Marshland does not receive many visitors. The tiny village of [Bronbog](bronbog) is the only permanent settlement in the swamp, but there are numerous [Lizardfolk](lizardfolk), [Bullywug](/monster/bullywug), and [Grung](grung) camps and villages scattered throughout. While there are few [orc](orcs) tribes in the valley, the ancient [Shrine of the Ruiner](shrine-of-the-ruiner) draws [orc](orcs) pilgrims from the [Frostweald](frostweald) and beyond.

The Dreamseep is plagued by undeath. Locals believe the marshland is cursed and many that die within the swamp are reborn as foul undead creatures. Legends tell of an ancient necropolis known as the [Tomb of Udah](tomb-of-udah). While other rumors tell of secret entrances to the [Underdark](underdark) and ways to the [Drow](elves) city of [Ruhn-Shak](ruhn-shak) deep beneath the [Stormpoint Mountains](stormpoint-mountains).

The only thing that brings visitors to the Dreamseep is the rare fungus known as "Queenscap". Used to create [Potions of Superior Healing](/item/potion-of-superior-healing), the Queenscap is nearly extinct in other swamps of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei).

### Dreamseep River
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Stormcrest^ ^Mountains^](stormcrest-mountains)

**^Type:^** ^Swamp^

The Dreamseep river is a slow moving river that begins in countless creeks and streams high in the [Stormcrest](stormcrest-mountains) and [Stormpoint](stormpoint-mountains) mountains to the north and west and runs a little under 200 miles to the [Kirmont Bay](kirmont-bay) in the south.

While the Dreamseep is wide, deep, and slow enough for small boats to make their way upriver to the village of [Bronbog](bronbog), the course of the river is difficult to follow through the maze that is the [Dreamseep Marshlands](dreamseep-marshlands). It is not uncommon for boats to become lost and stuck in vegetation choked channels that criss-cross the swamp.

Despite being located on the southern end of the [Dividing Plains](dividing-plains) at the base of the [Stormcrest Mountains](stormcrest-mountains), the Frostweald is frozen in perpetual winter. Cursed during the invasion of [Errevon the Rime Lord](errevon) during the [Icelost Years](icelost-years), is covered in snow and ice year round.

A very dangerous forest, the Frostweald's frigid weather is only one of the forest's many dangers. [Basilisks](/monster/basilisk) are common in the Frostweald and it is also home to the dangerous [Shivergut Tribe](shivergut-tribe). The Frostweald is also known for it's many gateways to the [Feywild](feywild) and fey creatures like [pixies](/monster/pixie), [dryads](/monster/dryad), and [nymphs](/monster/nymph) call the Frostweald home.

**^Type:^** ^Grassland^ ^&^ ^Swamp^

The Kirmont Valley is a large valley located on the [Lucidian](lucidian-ocean) coast of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei). The valley is wedged between the [Stormcrest Mountains](stormcrest-mountains) to the north and the [Stormpoint Mountains](stormpoint-mountains) to the west. The valley collects a lot of run-off from these two ranges and much of the valley is covered by the [Dreamseep Marshlands](dreamseep-marshlands).

While the [Dreamseep](dreamseep-marshlands) dominates much of the valley, it isn't all swamp. The western and southern edges of the Kirmont are at a higher elevation and significantly drier. A number of smaller rivers descend through the grasslands of the southern Kirmont and empty into the [Kirmont Bay](kirmont-bay) 

Very few people call the Kirmont Valley home. The village of [Bronbog](bronbog) is the only permanent settlement in the valley, but numerous tribes call the valley home. A start contrast of what was once a heavily settled region during the [Age of Arcanum](history). Many ruins litter the valley including the tower of [Wrettis](wrettis) in the foothills of the [Stormpoints](stormpoint-mountains) and the lost [Tomb of Udah](tomb-of-udah) in the heart of the marshlands.

The Beynsfal Plateau is an arid, rocky high plain located at the extreme southern tip of the [Rifenmist Peninsula](rifenmist-peninsula). A cruel and unforgiving landscape, it is littered with basalt, raw iron and not much else. It is a stark contrast to the rich and verdant [Rifenmist Jungle](rifenmist-jungle) to the north. 

The Beynsfal Plateau is a dangerous and inhospitable wasteland. The harsh climate is unforgiving for the unprepared and many dangerous beasts and monstrosities stalk the rocky flats looking for an easy meal. While travelers must be wary of these natural predators, the real threat comes from the [hobgoblins](hobgoblins) of the [Iron Authority](iron-authority).

The combined might of the city-states of [Rybad-Kol](rybad-kol), [Hdar-Fye](hdar-fye), [Ezordam-Haar](ezordam-haar), [Ortem-Vellak](ortem-vellak) and [Tz'Arrm](tzarrm) dominate the plateau and subjugate all in their path.

The Rifenmist Jungle is a massive rainforest that dominates the aptly named [Rifenmist Peninsula](rifenmist-peninsula) in southern [Tal'Dorei](taldorei). Larger than the [Verdant Expanse](verdant-expanse) and [Parchwood Timberland](parchwood-timberland) combined, the Rifenmist is [Tal'Dorei's](taldorei) largest forest at well over 100,000 square miles of wild, untamed wilderness.

The Rifenmist is divided in two by the [Stormpoint Mountains](stormpoint-mountains) with the western side being the larger of the two. Two large river basins dominate their respective halves with the [Rifenmist River](rifenmist-river) in the west and the [Orroyen River](orroyen-river) in the east.

While there are no permanent settlements in the jungle, the Rifenmist is home to numerous tribes of various races. The largest and most well-known being the [wood elves](elves) of the [Orroyen](orroyen-tribe). Also native to the jungle are most of [Exandria's](exandria) [tabaxi](tabaxi) clans.

**^Type:^** ^Jungle^

The Rifenmist River basin is the central artery that brings life to the western [Rifenmist Jungle](rifenmist-jungle). The main, or upper, branch of the Rifenmist River begins high on the western slope of the [Stormpoint Mountains](stormpoint-mountains) in the central [Rifenmist Peninsula](rifenmist-peninsula). From there, it carves it's way westward through the jungle, gaining water from countless smaller tributaries along the way. 

The largest of the Rifenmist's tributaries is the one most commonly referred to as the lower branch. The branch's source lies near the [hobgoblin](hobgoblins) city of [Ezordam-Haar](ezordam-haar) and heads northward into the heart of the jungle. The Rifenmist expands greatly at the confluence of the two branches and pushes westward for another hundred miles to the [Ozmit Sea](ozmit-sea).

### Feshun Narrows
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Verdant^ ^Expanse^](verdant-expanse)

**^Type:^** ^Coastal,^ ^Underwater^ ^&^ ^Forest^

The Feshun Narrows is small, narrow inlet off the [Ozmit Sea](ozmit-sea) that opens into a wide, sheltered bay where the [Feshun River](feshun-river) leaves the [Verdant Expanse](verdant-expanse). The water is a mixture of fresh and saltwater and the placid waters of the bay make the narrows a safe harbor from the many tropical storms that plaque the southeastern coast of [Tal'Dorei](taldorei).

While the narrows are a good place to ride out a storm, local clans of [Sahuagin](/monster/sahuagin) claim the narrows as their home and do not tolerate trespassers.

### Feshun River
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Verdant^ ^Expanse^](verdant-expanse)

**^Type:^** ^Forest^

The Feshun River begins it's journey to the [Ozmit Sea](ozmit-sea) high in the northwestern [Stormcrest Mountains](stormcrest-mountains). There it begins a 550 mile journey that descends from the mountains, through the city of [Syngorn](syngorn), plummets over the [Tormor Falls](tormor-falls), and winds through the [Verdant Expanse](verdant-expanse).

After the [falls](tormor-falls), the Feshun is joined by the [Vues'dal River](vuesdal-river) for the remainer of it's course through the [Expanse](verdant-expanse). The river is navigable by small boats through the forest, but is not a major trade route for the [elves](elves) of [Syngorn](syngorn).

> According to existing maps, the Vues'dal Waters is fed by the Feshun River, but this would mean the river flows in two directions at once.

> Having traveled these waters myself, I can attest to the direction of the Feshun and that the [Vues'dal River](vuesdal-river) flows from the [Vues'dal Waters](vuesdal-waters) to the Feshun and not the other way around.

### Gladepools
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Verdant^ ^Expanse^](verdant-expanse)

**^Type:^** ^Forest^ ^&^ ^Coastal^

The Gladepools are a collection of ponds and lakes that make up the southern border of the [Verdant Expanse](verdant-expanse) and stretch from the [Ozmit Sea](ozmit-sea) to the [Stormpoint Mountains](stormpoint-mountains). The pools are in important source of fish for the people of [Byroden](byroden) in the neighboring [Mornset Countryside](mornset-countryside). Likewise, the clay found on the banks is highly desired by potters and sculptors in [Syngorn](syngorn).

It is rumored that an oracle's spirit lives in the lakes of the Gladepools and will share information on one's future in exchange for an offering.

### Mirescar
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Verdant^ ^Expanse^](verdant-expanse)

**^Type:^** ^Forest^

The Mirescar is a dark corner of the [Verdant Expanse](verdant-expanse). Located on the western side of the forest, the Mirescar is one of the few places in the [Expanse](verdant-expanse) even the [elves](elves) of [Syngorn](syngorn) are reluctant to go. The entire area is corrupted by some unknown power and dire beasts, corrupted plant-life, and fey abominations call the Mirescar home.

### Orencleft
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Verdant^ ^Expanse^](verdant-expanse)

**^Type:^** ^Mountain^

Orencleft is a rocky mountain located to the south of the city of [Syngorn](syngorn) on the western end of the [Stormcrest Mountains](stormcrest-mountains). On the eastern side of the mountain, the [Feshun River](feshun-river) cascades down a series of falls known collectively as the [Tormor Falls](tormor-falls). 

Behind the falls, a number of caves dive deep into the [Stormcrests](stormcrest-mountains) and some say the entrances shift and move each day. The outside is patrolled by the [Verdant Guard](verdant-guard) and it is not uncommon for creatures to wander out from time to time.

**^Type:^** ^Mountain^ ^&^ ^Underdark^

Tormor Falls is a series of waterfalls where the [Feshun River](feshun-river) cascade down the eastern face of the [Orencleft Mountain](orencleft) on the west edge of the [Stormcrest Mountains](stormcrest-mountains). Numerous caves hide behind the various falls and lead deep into the [Orencleft](orencleft) and [Stormcrests](stormcrest-mountains). Stories tell of the caves shifting and changing each day.

Not far from the city of [Syngorn](syngorn), the base of the falls are patrolled by the [Verdant Guard](verdant-guard). While the surrounding area is relatively safe, plenty of explorers have entered the caves beneath the falls and were never heard from again.

### Vues'dal River
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Verdant^ ^Expanse^](verdant-expanse)

**^Type:^** ^Forest^

The Vues'dal River begins on the western slope of the [Stormpoint Mountains](stormpoint-mountains) and flows northwest for 80 miles before it empties into the [Vues'dal Waters](vuesdal-waters). It continues out the northern side of the lake before joining the [Feshun River](feshun-river) about a 100 miles south of [Syngorn](syngorn).

The portion of the river that connects the [Vues'dal Waters](vuesdal-waters) to the [Feshun River](feshun-river) is navigable and is used to ship food upriver, as far as the [Tormor Falls](tormor-falls) to [Syngorn](syngorn).

*^Canon^ ^Consistency:^ ^Medium^

> According to the Tal'Dorei Campaign Guide the [Feshun River](feshun-river) flows into the [Vues'dal Waters](vuesdal-waters), but this would mean the river flows north and south at the same time. Having visited the lake myself, the [Feshun River](feshun-river) does not enter the lake. The small [Vues'dal River](vuesdal-river) flows out of the lake and meets the [Feshun](feshun-river) to the north.

### Vues'dal Waters
[^Exandria^](geography) ^>^ [^Tal'Dorei^](taldorei) ^>^ [^Verdant^ ^Expanse^](verdant-expanse)

**^Type:^** ^Coastal^ ^&^ ^Forest^

Vues'dal Waters is a lake located in the southeastern corner of the [Verdant Expanse](verdant-expanse), tucked into a crook between the [Stormcrest Mountains](stormcrest-mountains) and [Stormpoint Mountains](stormpoint-mountains).

The lake was formed when the Vues'dal volcano erupted during the [Age of Arcanum](age-of-arcanum). The volcano collapsed in on itself, leaving behind a massive crater. Over time, water from the [Vues'dal River](vuesdal-river) flowed into the crater and created the Vues'dal Waters.

The land surrounding the lake is extremely fertile and farming villages have sprung up around it's banks. The largest is the town of [Vues'dal](vuesdal) on the eastern shore of the lake with roughly 1,000 people. In addition to the [elven](elves) settlements, a large [lizardfolk](lizardfolk) tribe lives in the nearby marshes and conflict between the two is not uncommon.
