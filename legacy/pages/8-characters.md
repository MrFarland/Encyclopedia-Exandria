# Characters
The world of Exandria is full of interesting characters that are as rich and vibrant as the world itself. Between the cast of NPCs from both campaigns and both the Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting Guide and Explorer's Guide to Wildemount, there are staggering number of characters in the Critical Role universe.

The purpose of this chapter is to provide you, the dungeon master of your own Exandrian adventures, with a comprehensive cast of characters from which you can draw from to better replicate the intricate and detailed world Matt and the rest of the cast have created for us.

Clemain Astural, the Sight Shepherd, was a powerful mage who resided in the tower of [Wrettis](wrettis) in the western [Kirmont Valley](kirmont-valley) during the [Age of Arcanum](age-of-arcanum).

He is largely forgotten by the general populace of [Exandria](geography), but his legend is still taught in the halls of various magical schools as a warning to students to be careful not to meddle in magics beyond them.

Hoping to find answers to many of [Exandria's](exandria) ills and an end to wars, Astural peered into the realm far beyond the planes. What he found was a being he called the "Sightless One". His discovery drove him to madness.

Eventually, Clemain Astural's madness turned outwards. His reputation as a respected scholar replaced by the moniker of mad mage. Many attempted to stop him, but it wasn't until a wizard named [Atz Yuminor](yuminor-atz), that his reign of terror came to an end and the tower of [Wrettis](wrettis) brought down.

#### Astural Scrolls
Astural wrote extensively of his research. These writings, called the Astural Scrolls, began innocently as simple notes on spells, potions, and star charts, but over time they became testaments of his madness. 

Many, but not all, of his scrolls were taken by [Yuminor](yuminor-atz) back to his home in the [Dividing Plains](dividing-plains), others may still lie in the ruins of [Wrettis](wrettis) or in the hands of collectors or adventurers that have already plundered the ruin.

Brimscythe the Iron Storm was an [adult blue dragon](/monster/adult-blue-dragon) and a member of the [Chroma Conclave](chroma-conclave). Also known as General Krieg, Brimscythe infiltrated the highest rungs of [Emonian](emon) society, earning the trust of [Sovereign Uriel Tal'Dorei III](taldorei-uriel-iii) and a position on the [Council of Tal'Dorei](council-of-taldorei).

Brimscythe was the youngest of the [Chroma Conclave](chrome-conclave) and served as the conclave's eyes and ears in Emon. He was eventually discovered by [Vox Machina](vox-machina) and killed.
