# 2. Pantheon
For the Gods of [Exandria](geography), Matthew Mercer drew heavily on the Dawn War pantheon first introduced in the 4th edition of Dungeons & Dragons. While many of the gods existed before 4th edition, this pantheon was the first time they were organized and used in this way.

While the gods of [Exandria](geography) are based on existing Dungeons & Dragons deities, they are not exact copies. The lore, domains, realms, and more have been modified to fit the setting of [Exandria](geography).

(print-column)

The pantheon is divided into two main factions, the benevolent [Prime Deities](prime-deities) and the malevolent [Betrayer Gods](betrayer-gods). There are also a number of [Lesser Deities](lesser-deities) and [Primordial Titans](primordials) to provide plenty of "higher powers" to pull strings and create story arcs for your players.

## Prime Deities
The Prime Deities are a collection of good and neutral aligned deities committed to the preservation of life on the world of [Exandria](geography). While these gods do not always agree and each has different interests, they are united in their opposition to the malevolent [Betrayers](betrayer-gods).

### Avandra
[^Pantheon^](pantheon) ^>^ [^Prime^ ^Deities^](prime-deities)

^Align:^ **^Chaotic^ ^Good^** ^-^ ^Domains:^ **^Trickery,^** **^Nature,^** **^Life^** 

![The Change Bringer](assets/img/pantheon-avandra.png =150x){.caption .float-right}

Avandra is the god of freedom, travelers, adventurers & trade. While Avandra did not create [halflings](halflings), they are close to her heart.

Avandra is typically depicted as a young woman with dark skin and long, wavy brown hair that trails behind her to form a long and winding road. 

Three wavy lines stacked vertically is another common symbol of the Change Bringer and is often used in designs to pay respects and gain her blessing subtly.

##### Commandments
- Luck favors the bold. Your fate is your own to grasp, & to do so is to have the Change Bringer behind you.
- Change is inevitable. The righteous can ensure that such change is for the better.
- Rise against tyranny. Fight for the freedom of yourself and others when you can, and inspire others to fight when you cannot.

#### Clergy
Of the [Prime Deities](prime-deities), Avandra's clergy is decentralized and informal. There is no formal organization or heirarchy. All priests are equals in the eyes of Avandra and her followers.

##### Holy Symbols
Symbols of Avandra are understated and modest. Most are simple good luck charms or handmade trinkets. Avandra's profile stamped on a coin and hung by a simple chain is about as ostentatious as they get.

##### Temples

Avandra is revered along the [Menagerie Coast](menagerie-coast) and popular in both [Tal'Dorei](taldorei) and [Marquet](marquet). Her worship is banned in the [Dwendalian Empire](dwendalian-empire) as her teachings are counter the [Empire](dwendalian-empire) doctrine and undermine the authority of the King.

Raei is often depicted as a female form with the head, wings, and legs of a phoenix. 

##### Commandments
