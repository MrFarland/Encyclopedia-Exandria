### Platinum Sanctuary
The Platinum Sanctuary is the most holy temple to [Bahamut the Platinum Dragon](bahamut-the-platinum-dragon) in all of [Exandria](geography). It is a grand, stone cathedral carved into the side of the [Heaven's Stair](heavens-stair) in the Silver Talon's Reach district of [Vasselheim](vasselheim). It is the central seat of the entire church of [Bahamut](bahamut-the-platinum-dragon) and the headquarters of the [Scalebearers](scalebearers).

A highly secure building, the Platinum Sanctuary is often used by the [Dawn Marshalls of Vasselheim](dawn-marshalls) in times of crisis.
